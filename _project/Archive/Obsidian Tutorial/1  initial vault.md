### Initial screen
![[obsidian_vault.png]]

- First thing you will need to do is set up a a **vault** in obsidian 
- Can either 
	- create a new vault 
	- open existing folder as vault
- The idea is to use one vault as insights can come from novel connections between ideas that aren't directly related at first glance
- Can maintain multiple vaults if it fits workflow better
	- Personal vs. Work
	- Archive
	- Very unrelated topics
	- Vault is too large to navigate

### Vault Switcher

- If you have multiple vaults you can switch from one to another by using the vault switcher
