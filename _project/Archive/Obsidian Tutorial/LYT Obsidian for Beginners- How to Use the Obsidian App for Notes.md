- **value of notes** grows over time
	- new notes in context of existing notes
- **linking benefits**
	- improves ability to remember concepts/thoughts/ideas

- no formatting bar at top because for text the idea is the most important piece
- with formatting out of the way can think about expressing thoughts and ideas

### 1. The Link
- Links are **strong direct connection** (not the only way to link ideas)
- Link autofill

### 2. Using Tags
- **weak connection**
- can be used as part of graph filter
- I use for reference/ note type rather than topic hierarchies

### 3. Using Italics
- used for emphasis
### 4. Using Bold
- used for emphasis
- I use for terminology
### 5. Lists/Bullet Points
- naturally forms
- can be used for ordered, unordered, and checklists
### 6. Header Levels
- Hierarchical 1-6
- Collapsible
- Can be exposed in other notes

##  8 keys settings
