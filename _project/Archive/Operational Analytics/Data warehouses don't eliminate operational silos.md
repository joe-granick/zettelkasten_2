## Topic
>In order to eliminate data silos, most companies choose to consolidate all of their data across all of their different sources into a centralized platform (i.e. the data warehouse) to gain a holistic understanding of their customers through analytics.

Companies use the data warehouse to standardize and centralize the data scattered across all of the SaaS tools in the stack.

Data warehouse ends up becoming it's own silo, accessible only to technical users of the analytics team.
