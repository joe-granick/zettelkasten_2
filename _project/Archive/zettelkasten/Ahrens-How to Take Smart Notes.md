## What kind of book is this?

## What is this book about?

## What are the major topics and how are they organized, related, and/or independent?

## Chapter  1: Introduction
Topic:
### 1 Everything you need to know
**5** most note taking don't take into account workflow

**6** typically impose hierarchical structure assuming linear process "making a plan"

**6** making a plan makes work inflexible

#### 1.1 Good solutions are simple- and unexpected
**8 -9** huge amount for complexity of topics and idea need to be connected to generate new insights

**8 -9** complexity makes inflexible systems useless

**9** solution is a flexible system that follows simple principles allowing emergent complexity[[Sull and Eisenhardt, 2015]]

** 9-10** two key ideas to this system
	- [[zettelkasten]] slip-box for managing information
	- change daily work routine around this information management system



**10** keeping everything involved in one place is critical to productivity

[[Newport-Deep Work]] flow state achieved by avoiding context switching



[[202207070707-Tools don't make a difference without appropriate workflow]]

[[202207070720-research and writing is a non-linear process]]

#### 1.2 The Slip-box

[[202207070701-Niklas Luhmann built a workflow that allowed him to become one of the most prolific researchers in academic sociology]]


#### flexibility key to adapting new information into new insight

**16** massive pre-planning and hierarchical structure inhibit ability to adapt new information

**16** also limit ability to make novel connections across content

**16** need to stay in control, and only way to stay in control in complex environment is with a system that keeps options open

**16** nature of insight-oriented writing is change
	- questions change
	- material is different than expectations
	- new ideas emerge

#### 16 Zettelkasten allowed control through  focus and flexibility
**pg 16** The flexibility of Luhmann's system allowed:
- immediate focus on what is important with material at hand
- could pick up where he left off
- afforded control due to flexibility

#### 17 it is not about the mindset but the workflow
**pg 17**success more dependent of a conducive environment over sheer force of will

#### 1.3 The slip-box manual
**18** Luhmann's workflow
**18** would take fleeting note as he read, noting bibliographic info on one side and 
brief notes about content on other

**19** would then revisit these points creating new card for each idea. These notes were meant o be an atomic idea, completely self-sustaining

**19** thoughts could be expanded upon with follow up cards, that logically flow from each other

**19** new notes/chains would then be integrated with existing notes where connections may exist, references to the new notes would be added to the relevant existing notes

**19** key was writing in own words and translating to new context

**19** didn't organize notes by topic, only by abstract numbering system, for new notes directly related he would place them directly behind related note

**20** whenever new note added would check box for any related notes and reference connections
- links allowed same note to be used in different contexts

**20** topics built organically bottom up, by starting with a note and following connections

**20** for built up topic he would create an index, with an entry point notes that could be followed to gather network of related notes

### 2 Everything you need to do
#### 21 Never start from a blank page

**21** Much easier to write a paper if rough draft is already prepared

**21** much easier to create rough draft if all research is in front of you and connected

**21-22** easy to manage ordering notes if they already exist and even more so if many are already ordered

**22** Zettelkasten allows bulk of work to be about learning and understanding the capturing it in notes
- notes build up while you think

**22** the rest becomes a process of organizing into a linear format for consumption

**22** additional work will be necessary to fill in a gap in reasoning or argument, but system makes it obvious to identify these gaps

**23** to truly understand something it needs to be in your own words

**23** Zettelkasten acts as scaffolding for thought, a second brain

#### 2.1 The writing process step by step
1. *Fleeting Notes* as a reminder, shouldn't distract from reading **23**
2. *Literature Notes* to capture important info on what you're reading and where to find it later for elaboration **24**
3. *Permanent Notes* elaborate on *fleeting and literature notes* these should be *atomic notes* one note for each idea **24**
4. *Slip-box* add new note to slip-box and make connections to existing notes in slip box **24**
	1. should be linked to index, or to an entry point note in index
5. *Develop topics* should be done ground up from interlinking topics, as they form use more directed research to enhance or challenge **25**
6. *Decide topic of interest* once topics reach a critical mass decide which ones are worth writing about. pull all relevant notes and start ordering, look for redundancies or missing info **25**
7. *Rough draft* tranlate notes to a rough draft **26**
8. Edit manuscript **26**

#### True strength of system is allowing multiple ideas to be developed at one time
**26** unlikely that anything you read will have specifically what you need and only that, system allows you to capture unrelated info that could be useful for future topics or expanding upon existing ones

### 3 Everything you need to have

**28** common tools of highlighting, underlying, notes in margin etc isolates info and makes process of connection difficult

#### 3.1 the toolbox
**29** basic Zettelkasten toolbox consist of 4 elements:
1. Something to write with and on **30**
2. Reference manager **30**
3. Slip-box **31**
4. Editor **31**

### 4 A few things to keep in mind

## Chapter  2: The Four Underlying Principles
### 5 Writing is the only thing that matters
**36** presentation and production of knowledge not separate
**37** writing is key ingredient in knowledge and discovery, but it cannot be separated from supporting aspects such as reading, from which most new writing will be generated
**37** approaching other elements of research with the guiding light being the writing of a new piece encourages a different approach to reading, lectures, and presentations
**37-38** reading is done with an ey towards questions and connections in existing work, forcing **deliberate practice**
**38** *deliberate practice* is critical to better understanding of a topic

### 6 Simplicity is paramount
**40** standard methods of underlying and keeping notes in margins isolates info to it's source, creating a large cognitive load when trying to remember where these notes are located
**40** in this system writing is separated from research and requires separate brainstorming with a preconceived topic in mind
**40-41** Old vs. New System:
	- *Old* "under which topic should I store this note"
	- *New* "In what context do I want to stumble upon this note again"
**41** slip-box is like shipping container for ideas
**41** becomes more valuable as it grows, whereas traditional systems become unwieldy tangled messes
**41-42** Prevent system from becoming unwieldy by being discriminate in which notes are important and maintain separation of powers between 3 branches of note-taking
1. **Fleeting notes**
	- capture ideas quickly while doing something else **43**
2. **Permanent notes**
3. **Project notes**
	 - stored in project-specific folder and deleted or archived once project is finished **45-46**

#### category-confusing mistakes
**43** these types of mistakes from well-meaning researchers make the benefit of note-taking decrease as volume of notes increases when it should be the opposite
**42** treating each note as permanent dilutes the slip box and creates a bloated infrastructure
**42** collecting only notes related to a specific project, either end up discarding everything, or end up with an abyss
**43** abyss of chaos from accumulation of unprocessed fleeting notes
**45** can't predict development as slip-box, permanent notes should be elaborated on so that they have the potential to be included in or inspire an end product, but that cannot be decided up front

#### importance of standardization
**45** standard format allows notes to build up to critical mass in one place
**45** facilitates thinking and writing process by removing complications and decisions
by not having to maintain formats and storage places
**45** because every note is in same format and same place they can be combined into a new whole later on
**45** no mental energy wasted on labelling and storage locating

### 7 Nobody starts from scratch
**47** start of process should **not** be narrowing by topic selections
**47** plans that pre-select topic are idealized and require diversions
**47-48** to develop a question or decide on a topic someone must have already done research beforehand
**48** decision of what to read rooted in prior understanding
**48** The **hermeneutic circle** 
**48** writing is taught as if moving forward in a straight line which is misleading as a sound plan cannot be made on what to write before having immersed oneself in a topic
**48** writing needs to accompany research, developing ideas on paper and building up a pool of externalized though **second brain**
**48** focusing on research of interest and tracking what is learned topics, questions, and arguments emerge naturally
**48** ideas that emerge will also form a usable base to develop from, as much content will already be written
**49** cluster represent both emergent topics as well as material ready to work with\
**49** alternatively starting with a blank page, isn't truly starting from scratch, but requires massive effort in retracing steps or redeveloping ideas
	- end up with messy step of "brainstorming"
**49** with linear process if research comes too early or too late can't really rearrange to suite need
**49-50** slip-box ongoing notes allows researcher to break this linear cycle
**50** problems caused by linearity
	 - not knowing what topic to choose
	 - intimidation of blank page
	 - stuck with unsatisfactory topic as deadline approaches
**50-51** if thinking has already been developed through writing writing can stay focused on what is interesting and will accumulate material along the way
**51** decision of the topic already made, as it has been made along the way by what you have chosen to research
**51** instead of focusing on choosing a topic focus shifts to improving already developed topics through informed decisions
**51** doing the work you can trust interesting questions will emerge. 
**51** Can't force insight in pre-destined direction, but minimize the risk of developing uninteresting topic or starting over from scratch

### 8 Let the work carry you forward
**54** non-linear system of writing and note taking creates feedback loops where ideas are revisited, corrected and improved regularly
**54** this deepens the understanding and memory of ideas and arguments as it is essentially performing active recall
**55** expressing in own words then trying to connect with other ideas exposes how robust understanding actually is
**55** revisiting allows us to review gaps in understandings new info is incorporated
**55** new info that conflict can deepen understanding into areas of why they conflict, is it contradictory, or is it a new case
**55** the search to incorporate new notes will naturally expose us to ideas that may not have been top of mind that can be potentially related
**56** analogous to the brain, learning becomes easier the more connections are made
