> **We can be more productive.** The Zettelkasten Method streamlines our workflow by giving clear guidelines on what to do. This, in turn, decreases friction. It is quite common to enter a stage of flow which further increases productivity. I even allocate two days per week to make Zettelkasten work my priority and [allow Zettelkasten flow](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/practical-integration-deep-work/) to happen.
