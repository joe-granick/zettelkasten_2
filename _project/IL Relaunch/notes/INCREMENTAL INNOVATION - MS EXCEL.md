| LAMBDA Function   | Legit                           | Allows creation of anonymous functions like FP language and makes Excel "Turing Complete"                                                              |
| Power Pivot       | Powerful for productivity       | Adds powerful abstractions for processing and relating data and creating custom calculations that can then be adjusted across a pivot table interface. |
| Forecast function | LOL                             | Please Don't                                                                                                                                           |
| 1M       + Rows   | Dangerous                       | Increases rows in spreadsheet from 100k+ to 1M+, but excel is not a DB and if you are using it to process 1M rows you're likely exceeding excels purpose|
