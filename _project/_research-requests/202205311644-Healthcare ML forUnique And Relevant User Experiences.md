## Topic
> Applying technological advances allows hundreds of healthcare plans to be held in a single, fluid system. As the AI better understands the data and behavior of its current customers within its software, it can constantly grow and evolve. The key is what this means for the person seeking healthcare.
>
>A system that can look at millions of data points and generate smart insights — without direction from a human agent — can be instantly scalable and create a robust user experience. The result is that consumers receive a web shop experience that caters to each user’s unique preferences because the platform has learned from each individual customer. The result is also an immense channel of communication with concierge-level service, guiding each consumer every step of the way with custom recommendations based on their specific needs and budget.
>
The ultimate goal is the best possible user experience, based on intuition drawn from relevant information and that weeds out the irrelevant.
