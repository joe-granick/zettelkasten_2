## Topic
>It's also important to mention the challenges that come with this technology. AI uses data to generate insights. It is difficult to use AI in the insurance purchasing process because access to data to generate these insights is hard to come by. To sell someone insurance, you need to know the details of their life, health, family, scheduled surgeries, etc., to inform the best recommendation for insurance and budget. On the phone you can talk through these needs, but a machine can’t access that information from a consumer directly. There will always be tension between asking questions, slowing down the process and crunching the numbers versus getting that data from other sources and piecing it together on the consumer's behalf.

>A lot of companies are still trying to figure out how to organize data in a way that can be consumed; this is a challenge right now as we are still in early adoption. How can consumers trust that a machine made the right choice for them? How can it save time and narrow down the best options — giving consumers the choice at the end of the day?
