# Getting Started: Taking Smart Notes in Obsidian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnktS_eAIxs&list=PL5tkaGAzZPyo527K4sJQbyM9FcRV86RM_&index=1
- stay basic to start


## Create Vault
- place where obsidian stores all files
- local first
- markdown 
	- (why markdown?)
- remote sync options
	- github

## Obsidian is Link First
- whole purpose is to build and organize notes through connections

## 3 Types of Notes (smart-notes)
1. Fleeting
2. Permanent
3. Literature

## Set Up Folders
- Each type of note given separate state
1. Create Folder for Daily Note
	-  used for capturing ideas throughout day similar to **fleeting note**
	- default folder
	- default format
	- **open today's daily note**
	- temporary and meant to be deleted
2. Reference Folder
	- Use it for literature notes
	- should be stored permanently
3. Slip-Box
	- Prefixer plug-in
	- Pros/Cons of naming
		- Descriptive name
		- Automatic + Keywords
			- avoid friction
		- ==Alias== best of both worlds
4. Inbox
	- For Processing
5. Project Folder
6. Templates

## Configure Plug-ins
- Prefixer
- Daily Note



# Take Fleeting Notes in Obsidian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-41huoERdxY&list=PL5tkaGAzZPyo527K4sJQbyM9FcRV86RM_&index=2
- **fleeting notes** temporary reminder of thoughts
- can take in daily note but not limited, any notes throughout day
	- notes app
	- physical notes
	- marginal notes
	- highlighting
- make sure to note where to find reference
- Ideally **process within a day of taking**
- user choice to leave or delete

# Take Literature Notes in Obsidian

- **literature note** tool for understanding
- Luhmann originally just used Lit notes for reminders
- **How to Read a Book**
	- Analytical Reading
	- Syntopical Reading
- I take fleeting notes directly within **Literature Note**
- **Literature** prompt for **permanent notes**
- Difficulty of material should dictate complexity of literature notes
	- more notes for more difficult material
	- more notes for material that is new to you
- Initial permanent notes will be comprised of first reading material
	- as reference corpus grows new notes inserted into existing notes
- I take literature style notes for extensive material like courses
- Time consuming

### How to Read a Book


# Take Permanent Notes in Obsidian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7oJF2V9GIc&list=PL5tkaGAzZPyo527K4sJQbyM9FcRV86RM_&index=4
- should be result of own thinking via **elaboration**
	- abstract idea from material
	- should be understandable outside of context of connected notes
	- Should represents ingle **atomic idea**
- ==highlight== note currently working on
- how should I elaborate to connect to other ideas
- not every fleeting or lit note needs to become a Zettel
- ==citations== for reference


# Add Smart Notes to the Slip Box in Obsidian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tx7g-JZpWgw&list=PL5tkaGAzZPyo527K4sJQbyM9FcRV86RM_&index=5
- adding notes multi-step process
- **Physical Zettelkasten**
	1. Add note 
		- Insert directly behind referenced note with branching sequence
		- Insert new note behind last note continuing with main sequence if it does not reference previous
	2. Add links to other notes or from other notes by reference ID
	3. Add note directly to index or reference in note already connected to index
- **Obsidian Zettelkasten**
	1. Add note directly behind note being references by starting or continuing sequence
		- prefixer automatically ordered by time 
		- may have to think ahead of time about sequence
	2. Add note-to-note links on or from related notes
	3. Add link to note directly in index, or add note-to-note link in a related note already connected to index sequence
		- have some leeway with search

**Sequence example**
https://youtu.be/tx7g-JZpWgw?t=358
- have a note ready to demonstrate
- probably from Data Science Design Manual

**Digital Index**
https://youtu.be/tx7g-JZpWgw?t=933
- *map of content*
- [ ] clean up DSM and organize into index


# Use Structure Notes to Organize Topics in Obsidian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lq-xEsLkaFQ&list=PL5tkaGAzZPyo527K4sJQbyM9FcRV86RM_&index=6

- **Hub-note** aka **structure-note** alternative to index for building a structure, to be used in addition of index
- minimum structure necessary
- structure notes are sub-index
- once structure gets to be 3-4 create a new index

# Link First Navigation in Obsidian for Smart Notes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqZu1Il8s2Q&list=PL5tkaGAzZPyo527K4sJQbyM9FcRV86RM_&index=7
- search can search body of notes
- want to be **browse first** because you want to rediscover notes
- can look at **backlinks**
- can look at **local graph**
- resurfacing question and ideas

# Build Projects from Smart Notes in Obsidian
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7SYRQEH-Fs&list=PL5tkaGAzZPyo527K4sJQbyM9FcRV86RM_&index=8
- **project notes**
- will need quantity vs quality
- probably will have overgrown initial nodes
- move writing to other tool
-

### Recommendations to start: 
- Don't try to capture everything to start
- Start with a book
- Start with physical index cards
- Figure out your own methods
