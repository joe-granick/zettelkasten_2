## Luhmann's Zettelkasten
[[202207070701-Niklas Luhmann built a workflow that allowed him to become one of the most prolific researchers in academic sociology]]

## Why Are We So Interested In Luhmann’s Zettelkasten?

>First, we fantasize about what it would mean to be as productive as Luhmann. Luhmann’s Zettelkasten seems to inspire people, which is one of the main drivers why interest in his method of production is surging.

>Second, Luhmann’s Zettelkasten promises to be quite an improvement to run-of-the-mill approaches to note-taking and knowledge work in general. It amplifies your effectiveness. It is possible to produce more in less time, but not with less effort per time. If we accept this we can improve ordinary note-taking methods in several ways:

### Zettelkasten Improves Connectivity of Thought
[[202207070705-Zettelkasten facilitates connectivity of ideas]]
### Zettelkasten Improves Productivity
[[202207070723-Zettelkasten increases productivity by reducing friction]]

### Zettelkasten Can Prevent Wasted Effort
[[202207070732-Zettelkasten reduces wasted effort and preserves information in a state ready to be incorporated into future research]]
### Zettelkasten Facilitates Complex Problem Solving
[[202207070735-Zettelkasten facilitates complex problem solving by decomposing into atomic components]]
### Normal Note-Taking Creates Inflexible Silos of Info
[[202207070739-traditional note-taking creates high friction through overcomplication and forces compartmentalization of notes and processes]]
### Zettelkasten Facilitates Easier More Complete and Understandable Writing

We have to make notes to wrestle with problems effectively. To put it in Luhmann’s words:
>
What are we to do with what we have written down? Certainly, at first, we will produce mostly garbage. But we have been educated to expect something useful from our activities and soon lose confidence if nothing useful seems to result. We should, therefore, reflect on whether and how we arrange our notes so that they are available for later access.

The result of Luhmann’s own note-taking effort was his Zettelkasten. Let’s dive in and see how he achieved this to extract some general principles.
