## Topic
>Businesses are also leveraging Operational Analytics in Product Analytics platforms like Amplitude, and Mixpanel to help companies derive better insights into how their customers are using their products. A common use case revolves around getting information like user id, service area, or product usage information into these product analytic tools to generate more insights. This enables more complex and deeper analysis on a more granular level, while also ensuring that different teams have the same view of the customer.

[Zeplin was able to achieve this using Hightouch](https://hightouch.io/customers/zeplin/). Mixpanel, Zeplin's product analytics tool, had events and reports on how certain customers were using the product. But it didn't have context into Zeplin specific concepts, such as how many Projects a given user had, so Zeplin used Hightouch to enrich group profiles in Mixpanel. This enabled the team to answer questions like "How often do organizations with 5 collaborators log in using SSO?". All of this helped Zeplin segment its customer base and decide on its pricing strategy.
