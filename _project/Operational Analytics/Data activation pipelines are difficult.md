## Topic
>Data Activation is not a new concept, companies have been trying to activate their data for years and map first-party data and third-party data back into their operational tools. The problem is, that it’s difficult to move data out of the warehouse and sync it back into business tools. It requires the engineering team to [integrate with third-party APIs](https://hightouch.io/blog/how-to-integrate-with-third-party-apis/) and build a custom integration and entirely new data pipelines for every single destination where data needs to be sent/available. Maintaining this at scale is nearly impossible and this is not even accounting for the cost and resources required to keep just one of these pipelines up and running on a consistent basis.
