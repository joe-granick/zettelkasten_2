>Data Activation shifts the focus from simply understanding data to taking action on it. In most scenarios, the data warehouse stores all of the unique business logic for advanced analytics. Once this data is transformed and modeled it can feature customer attributes like:
>- Recent signups
.-   Shopping cart abandonment
.-   Items in cart
.-   Lifetime value
.-   Lead score
.-   Annual recurring revenue
.-   Session length
.-   Pages viewed
.-   Resources downloaded
.-   Messages sent
.-   Subscription type
.-   Product qualified leads
.-   Workspaces created
.-   Playlists

>This list could go on and on, and these are just a few examples. The problem is that business teams are often forced to hop back and forth between sales, marketing, product, finance, and support tools. because the ideal customer profile exists in the warehouse. The question is, how valuable is this information if itâ€™s not actionable and accessible to the appropriate business teams. All of this data should, and can be used to automate/optimize business processes to create a seamless experience for the customer.

While these metrics may be useful if referenced when making a decisin, they are often buried in a sea of charts and metrics in dasboards, or lost in abyss of the warehouse. A decsion maker trying to rationally adjust their apporach based on the data will face an incredibly broken workflow due to the context switchin of changing tools and tasks, and will be unable to hit a flow state where they will be truly effective.

Data activation places data where it will be relevant, so it is easily put in it's context and can be used to rationally affect decsion making, and facilitate richer customer interactions
