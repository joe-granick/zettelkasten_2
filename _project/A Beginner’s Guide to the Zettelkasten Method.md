### Problem with note taking

### Zettel facilitates learning and understanding through connection
>The Zettelkasten method encourages you to connect the dots between different trains of thought and knowledge. The steps facilitate our intrinsic ability to generate new connections between ideas, and thus increase our knowledge and productive output.
>
>The Zettelkasten method is good for when you want to:
>-   Systematically organize important information
>-   Find information again, even years later
>-   Develop your own ideas
>
>In short, the Zettelkasten method is an integrated system for dealing with knowledge in your life, and acts as an amplifier of your endeavors in the realm of writing and knowledge management.

### Knowledge management system is process for organize research, thoughts, and ideas coehsively a "Second Brain"
>Knowledge management (KM) is the process of creating, sharing, using, and managing knowledge and information. The main objective is to make the best use of existing knowledge.
>
>When creating a personal knowledge management system, you ultimately develop a system and structure for organizing your ideas, thoughts, and information in a way that suits your thinking. In a way, you develop a web of knowledge and build up a “second brain” of all the information that you collect to help fuel an emergent approach of thinking.


### Zettelkasten is an index card based system to organize ideas thoughts and information
>Zettelkasten is a german word which translates to ‘note box’. The definition explains what material to work with and the filing system used. Let’s break it down into its parts:
>
>A ‘zettel’ is a slip or note of paper. Information we wish to keep gets written on a Zettel. A classic form of a Zettel is a sticky note, an index card, or piece of notepad paper for writing down your thoughts. 
>
>The word ‘kasten’ literally translates to box. In this context, however, it’s specifically an index card box. Index card boxes allow for an organized filing system keeping like-minded notes or zettel grouped and categorized in one place.
>
>Following the definition, the Zettelkasten method can be explained as an index card knowledge management system that helps you to retain information that resonates with you, which you then organize, identify, and categorize, to ultimately convert into creative output.
>
>In short, a **Zettelkasten is simply a framework to help organize your ideas, thoughts, and information. By relating pieces of knowledge and connecting information to each other (by way of hyperlinking), you are replicating a train of thought.** By establishing relationships between pieces of knowledge, you are helping retain consumed information allowing your thinking process to grow organically.

### Niklas Luhmann developed the Zettelkasten as a system of manual hyperlinks
>Niklas Luhmann is the brain behind the system. The german sociologist is the founder of the smart note-taking and knowledge management system, the Zettelkasten method. He was extremely productive in his career, writing 70 books and more than 400 scholarly articles!
>
>As a researcher, Luhmann was constantly reading and learning. In order to build upon his existing knowledge, he developed the systems theory we know of as Zettelkasten today. Luhmann focused on understanding the information he read and making connections to existing information. For this, he used a paper-based system to categorize all the information he read and collected.
>
>Luhmann collected information on a Zettel, categorized and filed it appropriately in his archive, which was indeed a piece of furniture with lots of drawers. He meticulously built a web of his knowledge that helped him retrieve information and develop new ideas efficiently.
>
>To translate Luhmann’s Zettelkasten method to our digital age, his method of organization is an analog system to what we now know as hyperlinking. Thus, the Zettelkasten system can be likened to or described as the first Wiki.
