**[02:45]** most writing books assumptions don't fix problem of taking notes but exacerbate them

**[03:32]** Richard Feynman took notes seriously, when someone commented that they were "great records" of think he replied that no "they were his thinking"

**[05:29]** "Notes on paper, or on a computer screen... do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavor easier, they make it possible"
- no matter how internal processes are implemented need to understand extent to which mind relies on external scaffolding

**[06:45]** Working in administration w/ law background, Luhmann would take notes as he went along

- became prolific professor in Sociology research

**[09:30]** Zettelkasten was tool he used

**[15:20]** It's not about the tool, but the workflow this process facilitates
1. note sequences are for developing ideas not storing information... idea can be developed further by adding a new note
2. links and indices are helpful but are not the central feature, they are just entry points into thought sequences on the notes
3. workflow is streamlined for writing
	 - take notes out
	 - sequence in an order
	 - rearrange as necessary
	 - fill in gaps where they appear
	 - convert to a written text
4. Main types of notes
5. One idea per note

**[18:40]** majority of guides follow linear approach

**[20:20]** change thinking from notes as records to notes as thinking
need to have read a lot before if you are going to know which resources to use

linear model compartmentalizes these elements, but they really all need to be worked on simultaneously

**[23:30]** workflow implemented with appropriate tool makes the difference

If you can't explain own words you don't really understand it

How can you make it easier to write the paper
- much easier if you have the notes prepared

Question toward end of research may be very different than one you started with
