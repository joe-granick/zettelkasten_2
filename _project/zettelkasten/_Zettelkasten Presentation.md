**note:** 
- Zettelkasten allows ideas to be developed as research is conducted
- It allows you to defer decision making until later (source of procrastination)
	- No need to decide on a topic beforehand
	- Topics develop organically
	- Selection can be done by gravity of connections
	- No need to deal with blank page syndrome
		-  Don't waste time extracting ideas for manuscript, note sequences can be composed as needed and converted quickly due to way they were written

ZK Reduces Wasted Effort

System improves as notes are added

</grid>


**note:**
- Many times notes become less useful as more are added but ZK improves as notes are added
- Normally have to pre-decide a topic then conduct research this could result in unsatisfactory topics, or the the risk of having to change directions since ideas will already be well developed and topics with an adequate amount of content arise naturally and are indicated by clusters of notes and sequences
- No need  to look through books for highlighted sections or gambling on potentially dead-end sources
- Work done feeds back into the network, since it is connection based the system becomes stronger as more notes added
- Won't lose work because it was connected to a specific project or the reference can't be found

ZK Facilitates Natural Complexity through Composed Simplicity

<grid drag="45 85" drop="0 15"  align="topleft" style="font-size:25px">

*Conway's game of life demonstrates **emergence** and **self-organization** with cellular automaton*
</grid>




**note:**
- each note represents one atomic idea allowing one to focus on building a complete thought
- connections allow one to step back and compose more complex topics from each of these building blocks like stacking shipping containers
- Gives a standard unit for an idea, more complex topics are just built up from these bricks
- **emergence** occurs when an entity is observed to have properties its parts do not have on their own, properties or behaviors which emerge only when the parts interact in a wider whole.
- **Self-organization** is a process where some form of overall [order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_and_disorder "Order and disorder") arises from local interactions between parts of an initially disordered [system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System "System"). It is often triggered by seemingly random [fluctuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_fluctuations "Statistical fluctuations"), amplified by [positive feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback "Positive feedback"). The resulting organization is wholly decentralized, [distributed](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/distribute "wikt:distribute") over all the components of the system. As such, the organization is typically [robust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_(disambiguation) "Robust (disambiguation)") and able to survive or self-repair substantial perturbation. [Chaos theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory "Chaos theory") discusses self-organization in terms of islands of [predictability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictability "Predictability") in a sea of chaotic unpredictability.
- **A cellular automaton** consists of a regular grid of _cells_, each in one of a finite number of _[states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(computer_science) "State (computer science)")_, such as _on_ and _off_ (in contrast to a [coupled map lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupled_map_lattice "Coupled map lattice")). The grid can be in any finite number of dimensions. For each cell, a set of cells called its _neighborhood_ is defined relative to the specified cell. An initial state (time _t_ = 0) is selected by assigning a state for each cell. A new _generation_ is created (advancing _t_ by 1), according to some fixed _rule_ (generally, a mathematical function)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton#cite_note-3) that determines the new state of each cell in terms of the current state of the cell and the states of the cells in its neighborhood.

ZK Facilitates Clarity of Reasoning Through Idea Chains

Sequence of reasoning can be developed one note at a time

**note:**
- strength of Zettel is the emphasis on connection
- connections facilitate better understanding, since you are writing with the aim of relating to other information you are building stronger relationships in ideas
- building relationships helps identify patterns

**note:**
- beyond developing individual pieces of work you are deepening your understanding

Luhmann used the Zettelkasten to build a prolific career as a Sociology professor
<br><br>
Over 30 years he managed to:
- Publish 50 books
- Wrote over 600 articles
- Several works published posthumously, leaving 150 manuscripts when he died
 <br><br>
Luhmann built a note-taking system based on slips of paper to develop his "Theory of Society" over his career
<br><br>
Named the system **"Zettelkasten"** which translates to "slip-box"

**note:**
1.  **A unique identifier**. This gives your Zettel an unambiguous address.
2.  **The body of the Zettel**. This is where you write down what you want to capture: The piece of knowledge.
3.  **References**. At the bottom of each Zettel, you either reference the source of the knowledge you capture or leave it blank if you capture your own thoughts.

**note:**
- sequence can be used to develop reasoning one idea at a time
- links can be used to associate related material
- context is key, links won't be helpful if you don't know the context for those links. 
	- for directly related slips in sequence it is more feasible, but being clear about the context for the the sequence greatly reduces cognitive load when revisiting
- key is to express idea in own words with the frame of reference of how it relates to your other work
