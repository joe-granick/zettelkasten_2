 Nklas Luhmann developed the Slip-Box and leveraged it to build a prolific career in Sociology research [^1]

 Luhman noticed that note-taking wasn't going anywhere because of the lack of context

stopped w/ margin notes and organizing by category or book [^2]

started just writing down thoughts/info on slips of paper and set up a numerical system for organizing and connecting slips of paper[^2]

**13-14** used slip-box method to transition into Academia as Sociology professor. in 30 years published 58 books and 600+ articles[^3]
	- even more published posthumously from existing notes
