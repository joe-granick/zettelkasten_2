**Gas.** Compute and display the price a person will pay for gas at the gas station. Read the price per gallon, the number of gallons of gas that were purchased, and whether the person pays cash or credit to pay. If the person pays with a credit card, there is an extra charge of 10% of the total price.
Gas is never free. A person stopping to buy gas will always buy some amount of gas. Note that zero as an input would incur on an error condition.
