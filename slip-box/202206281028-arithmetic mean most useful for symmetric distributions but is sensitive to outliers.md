The *arithmetic mean* is most useful for characterizing symmetric distributions like the *normal distribution*, as it is very sensitive to outliers, and can be moved to a large amount with just a single MAXINT if the total number of observations isn't large enough compared to the magnitude of difference[^1]

For datasets with outlier or distributions with a high degree of skewness like *power lar distributions* and *exponential distributions* the *median* is a better measure of central tendency[^2]
