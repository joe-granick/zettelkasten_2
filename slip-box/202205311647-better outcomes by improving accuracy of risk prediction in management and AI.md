## Topic
>Itâ€™s important to note that a majority of the price consumers pay when enrolling in health insurance goes into risk prediction and risk management. By using AI to create a system that can create more accurate risk models and predict which individuals need specific types of care, health insurance providers can spend more money on their beneficiaries and less on those processes. Platforms that can take in, study and learn from data, refine judgments and generate intelligent insight can also greatly reduce the need for expensive human data analysts.
