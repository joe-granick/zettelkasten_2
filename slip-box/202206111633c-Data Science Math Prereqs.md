## Math Forms the Foundation of Data Science 
A base level of understanding of the mathematical foundation of data science is necessary before insight can be extracted from numerical data to produce rigorous conclusions and trustworthy results^[ [[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual 1st]] **pg 27**]

#### elaborate
 Need to know what assumptions go into model

 Need to know how to translate a real world phenomenon into a representative numerical model, that adequately captures the critical variables of interest

Need to know nuances of the set of numbers making up a variable to understand it's meaning for the phenomenon, and how that translates to a model

Need to know how algorithms and models work from a mathematical perspective to understand limitations, and how they may be adjusted

### Probability
Probability provides the formal framework for reasoning about likelihood and uncertainty with a vocabulary that connects the theory to the applied science of statistics^[ [[202206111633c2-probability provides formal framework for assessing uncertainty]]] 


### Statistics
Statistics is needed to translate real world data into a form for which probability theory can be brought to bear ^[[202206111633c3- statistics bridges the gap between probability theory and real world data|202206111633c3]]
