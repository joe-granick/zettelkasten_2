# Data Science

## DS academic influences
- thinking like a **scientist** vs. **computer scientist** vs. **statistician** [[202206111633a1 - think like a computer scientist act like a statistician understand like a domain expert|202206111633]]
	- **science vs computer science**
		-  **computer science** provides algorithms and tools as well as mindset for composing solutions
		- **physical science** and **social science** provide methodology for experiment design and evaluating evidence
		- 
### Mathematics
- foundation of data science [[202206111633c-Data Science Math Prereqs|202206111633c]]
- understanding of *mathematics* crucial [[202206111633c1- mathematical intuition is critical for data science|202206111633c1]]  

#### Probability and Statistics
-  [[202206111633c1a-Probability and statistics provide tools to analyze data|202206111633c1a]]

##### [[probability]] 

##### [[statistics]]

##### probability vs stats
- [[202206111633c3- statistics bridges the gap between probability theory and real world data|202206111633c3]]
- data is messy in real world [[202206111633c3a-data usually comes from measuring observed events|202206111633c3a]]
- probability predicts likelihood of future events statistics analyzes frequency of past events [[202206111633c3b-probability theory of future likelihood, stats applied to frequency of past events|202206111633c3b]]
	

## Practicality and context in data science
- practical data science focuses on actionable insights [[202206121102- practical data science emphasizes getting the basics right and actionable insights|202206121102]]
- **statistical proxy** [[202206121102b-a statistical proxy is needed when specifically related measure or dataset is unobtainable|202206121102b]]

## Data Properties
data properties impose constraints on potential analysis
- [[202206151429- understanding properties of data is important to what types of analysis are appropriate]] **elaborate**
	- Structured vs. Unstructured [[202206151429a-data can be structured or unstructured]]
	- Qualitative vs Quantitative [[202206151429b-data can be quantitative or qualitative]]
	- Volume [[202206151429c-big data vs. small data]]

## Examples of suitable data sets
- **baseball** structure as a game made up of discrete events combine with it's long history of detailed broad record keeping make it a great dataset to ask interesting questions of both related and unrelated to baseball - -               
	- [[202206151430-baseball has many characteristics of a good dataset for DS|202206141913]]
	- [[202206151430a-using baseball records to examine questions related and unrelated to baseball|202206151430a]]
- **IMDB**
- **Google n-gram**
- **NY taxi data**

## Types of Machine Learning 
- [[202206161754- ML approaches divided into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning|202206161754]]
### supervised learning
-  [[202206161754a-supervised learning most common challenge in DS classification or regression|202206161754a]] 
- [[202206161754a1-regression and classification problems can typically be recast as the other|202206161754a1]]

### unsupervised learning

### reinforcement Learning


# Computer Science

**Data-Type**
- Formally defined by value domain and associated operations[[202207121923-data types formally defined by values and operations|202207121923]]

- **Strong Typing**
	- Important to know data-type to prevent errors, especially for **strongly typed** languages (eg *Java*) [[202207121924a1--must always be aware of data typed used in program written in strongly typed language|202207121924]]
- **Primitive**
- **Built-in**
	

## Programming
**4 Basic elements in almost every language**
1. assignments
2. conditionals
3. loops
4. arrays
### Paradigms
- **Procedural**
- **Functional**
- **Object-Oriented**
- **Logic**
- **Declarative**
- **Imperative**


## Data structures

### Array
