# Data Science

## [[DS academic influences]]
- thinking like a **scientist** vs. **computer scientist** vs. **statistician** 


	

## Practicality and context in data science
- practical data science focuses on actionable insights [[202206121102- practical data science emphasizes getting the basics right and actionable insights|202206121102]]
- **statistical proxy** [[202206121102b-a statistical proxy is needed when specifically related measure or dataset is unobtainable|202206121102b]]

## [[data properties]]
data properties impose constraints on potential analysis -

# Computer Science

**Data-Type**
- Formally defined by value domain and associated operations[[202207121923-data types formally defined by values and operations|202207121923]]

- **Strong Typing**
	- Important to know data-type to prevent errors, especially for **strongly typed** languages (eg *Java*) [[202207121924a1--must always be aware of data typed used in program written in strongly typed language|202207121924]]
- **Primitive**
- **Built-in**
	

## Programming
**4 Basic elements in almost every language**
1. assignments
2. conditionals
3. loops
4. arrays
### Paradigms
