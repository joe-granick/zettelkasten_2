# Data Science
**academic influences on data science**
- thinking like a **scientist** vs. **computer scientist** vs. **statistician** [[202206111633b - think like a computer scientist act like a statistician understand like a domain expert|202206111633]]
	-  **computer science** provides algorithms and tools as well as mindset for composing solutions
	- **physical science** and **social science** provide methodology for experiment design and evaluating evidence
- **mathematics** forms foundation of data science [[202206111633c-Data Science Math Prereqs|202206111633c]]
	- understanding of *mathematics* crucial to data science [[202206111633c1- mathematical intuition is critical for data science|202206111633c1]] 
	- **probability** and **statistics** provide the tools to analyze data [[202206111633c1a-Probability and statistics provide tools to analyze data|202206111633c1a]]
		- *probability* [[202206111633c2-probability provides formal framework for assessing uncertainty|202206111633c2]]
		- *statistics* bridges the gap between real world and idealized world of probability [[202206111633c3- statistics bridges the gap between probability theory and real world data|202206111633c3]]
			- data is messy in real world [[202206111633c3a-data usually comes from measuring observed events|202206111633c3a]]
			- probability predicts likelihood of future events statistics analyzes frequency of past events[[202206111633c3b-probability theory of future likelihood, stats applied to frequency of past events|202206111633c3b]] 

**importance of practicality and context in data science**
- practical data science focuses on actionable insights [[202206121102- practical data science emphasizes getting the basics right and actionable insights|202206121102]]


**data properties impose constraints on potential analysis*
- [[202206151429- understanding properties of data is important to what types of analysis are appropriate]] **elaborate**
	- Structured vs. Unstructured [[202206151429a-data can be structured or unstructured]]
	- Qualitative vs Quantitative [[202206151429b-data can be quantitative or qualitative]]
	- Volume [[202206151429c-big data vs. small data]]

**examples of datasets suitable for data science**
- baseball structure as a game made up of discrete events combine with it's long history of detailed broad record keeping make it a great dataset to ask interesting questions of both related and unrelated to baseball [[202206141913-baseball has many characteristics of a good dataset for DS|202206141913]]

**Types of Machine Learning** [[202206161754- ML approaches divided into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning|202206161754]]
- **supervised learning**
	- For practical applications, majority of DS solutions should be cast as **supervised learning** problems [[202206161754a-supervised learning most common challenge in DS classification or regression|202206161754a]] 


# Computer Science

**Data-Type**
- Formally defined by value domain and associated operations[[202207121923-data types formally defined by values and operations|202207121923]]

- **Strong Typing**
	- Important to know data-type to prevent errors, especially for **strongly typed** languages (eg *Java*) [[202207121924-must always be aware of data typed used in program written in strongly typed language|202207121924]]
- **Primitive**
- **Built-in**
