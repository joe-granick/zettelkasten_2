>"Think like a computer scientist but act like a statistician"^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg vi**]

Data science links computer science with statistics and domain specialists/subject matter experts. Each domain has distinct tools and philosophies when approaching problems, good data scientists will incorporate tools from several domains, as no one discipline has a monopoly on the truth, and different areas offer different approaches which may work better, or combine to make a better whole solution.^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg vi**]

Data scientists need to reconcile differences between various disciplines and create a coherent approach to a problem

**Computer Science** provides algorithmic methods of data, that work at the scale of modern data, allow prediction on much more detailed sets of data, allowing more accurate and responsive predictions. Machine Learning one of primary contributions, provides scale. 

Algorithmic thinking should be emphasized as well, as it is helpful in structuring problems, and understanding what form a solution can take

**Statistics** traditionally has much more rigorous treatment of data than computer science, this respect for data and methods of statistical reasoning are also foundational to data science. Data scientists need to go beyond the algorithmic tools/focus on scale from CS but also the core values of statistics including the understanding of the application domain, appreciation for the principles of small data, value of significance and an intellectual curiosity and exploration for the data ^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg vi**]
**Domain Experts** are critical to understanding the context of the problem. Their contextual understanding is crucial to translating the problem into data analytics solution. Further their expertise can help with assumptions built into features and how outputs should be structured when solutions require hierarchies of models^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg vi**]

Data scientists therefore need to be able to collaborate across disciplines in order to define and translate problems from various domains into into ones for which analytical tools can be applied.
