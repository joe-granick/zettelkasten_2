## Contract Management
>
**The main challenge firms face in contracting arises from the sheer number of contracts they must keep track of; these often lack uniformity and are difficult to organize, manage, and update.** Most firms don’t have a database of all the information in their contracts – let alone an efficient way to extract all that data – so there’s no orderly and fast way to, for example, view complex outsourcing agreements or see how a certain clause is worded across different divisions. It requires a lot of manpower to draft, execute, and improve not only the contracts themselves, but also the contracting processes and the transactions these contracts govern.
>
**AI software, however, can easily extract data and clarify the content of contracts. (It could quickly pull and organize the renewal dates and renegotiation terms from any number of contracts.)** It can let companies review contracts more rapidly, organize and locate large amounts of contract data more easily, decrease the potential for contract disputes (and antagonistic contract negotiations), and increase the volume of contracts it is able to negotiate and execute.
>
In my research, I have seen that many companies use contract management software, and a smaller number of firms – mostly those with a high volume of routinized contracts – use more advanced software with AI capabilities. These firms have generally seen an increase in productivity and efficiency in their contracting.
>
The use of AI contracting software has the potential to improve how all firms contract – and it will do so in three ways: by changing the tools firms use to contract, influencing the content of contracts, and affecting the processes by which firms contract.[^1]

### Improved Tools for Managing Contracts
>
While software for legal document review has existed for years, it typically only helps companies store and organize their contracts. Contracting software that uses AI raises the bar for what these tools can accomplish. **AI contracting software can, for example, identify contract types (even in multiple languages) based on pattern recognition in how the document is drafted. Because AI contracting software trains its algorithm on a set of data (contracts) to recognize patterns and extract key variables (clauses, dates, parties, etc.), it allows a firm to manage its contracts more effectively because it knows – and can easily access – what is in each of them.** AI software also offers simple prediction, which has implications for due diligence: AI contracting software can quickly sort through a large volume of contracts and flag individual contracts based on firm-specified criteria.
>
**Current AI software can also read contracts accurately in any format, provide analytics about the data extracted from the contracts, and extract contract data much faster than would be possible with a team of lawyers.** This may sound like bad news for lawyers, but this is not necessarily the case: having additional contract data could allow firms to update their contracts more regularly, and lawyers could focus more on their role as counsel instead of contract reviewer.[^1]

### Keeping Contracts Consistent
>
**AI contracting software helps firms keep terms and usage consistent in all of their contracts. For example, if a company wants to define the term “confidential information” in a specific way in its non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), it must make sure that all of its divisions are on board with this definition,** and that changes to the definition get incorporated quickly and accurately, because variation could prove damaging to the company. AI contracting software can easily keep this term consistent across the firm’s templates, and it can spot other terms that signal “confidential information” in NDAs from business partners.
>
**Being able to identify and extract key data points helps firms organize and execute contracts as well. For example, a company with a large number of vendor contracts must ensure that they are keeping track of variations in termination provisions and penalty and damage provisions – both in their own contracts and in vendor contracts.** Managing variations is a huge undertaking that requires proactive organization. But AI contracting software can record and standardize these provisions in the company’s contracts and in those that vendors send, making it far easier to identify instances of noncompliance and ensure that unfavorable provisions are dealt with promptly.
>
**Additionally, AI contracting software can quickly assess risk in contracts (performing the risk analysis much faster than a team of lawyers) by identifying terms and clauses that are suboptimal. And it can reduce the risk of human error in contract drafting and review.**[^1]


## NLP
### What is natural language processing?
>
Natural language processing (NLP) is another form of artificial intelligence that enables computers to analyze, understand, and derive meaning from human language. Stated another way, it is the ability of a computer program to recognize and interpret human linguistic patterns and tendencies so that users can submit queries using their natural language instead of “computerspeak.” In the legal industry, this means large amounts of research and data can be queried using common language spoken in the legal world.
>
For an NLP-based solution to be effective it must be tailored to the specific application. Given that the words, phrases, and entities used in the legal industry have very specific meanings, an NLP-based solution developed for attorneys must account for those meanings and legal concepts.
>
As an example, Bloomberg Law’s NLP-based search system was developed, in part, by measuring performance against relevance judgments obtained from a panel of legal analysts, as well as by viewing the actual interaction of users with the search system. This evaluation helped the Bloomberg Law search team identify where the system did and did not perform well. Using that information, the team designed system improvements to better understand what attorneys found relevant and address the underperforming queries.
>
**Bloomberg Law’s NLP system also can parse search queries to identify the entities contained within it and assess the relationships between those entities. An “entity” for this purpose could be a statute or regulation, a person, a court, or even a legal concept (e.g., strict liability). Documents discussing those entities are then identified and scored based on how prominently the entities are featured and how they are related in the document.**[^2]

### Natural language processing for legal intelligence
>
**In today’s legal world, this worry of not finding the right information is exacerbated by the insurmountable amount of online legal information** – court opinions, agency materials, statutes, regulations, books, practice guides, law reviews, legal white papers, news – the list goes on and on. Information overload has resulted in a lack of confidence in the legal research process, often leaving attorneys unsure of whether they have found the right information, which makes the application of artificial intelligence all the more important.
>
As one can imagine, given the amount of legal data, it can also be challenging to accurately identify and disambiguate names of persons and organizations appearing in legal documents. Being able to do this well is important for finding the right information.
>
For example, in many instances the name of a law firm as mentioned in a legal document may not match the official name of the firm. The name appearing may be an informal version, a misspelling, or even an outdated name. Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP may be shortened to “Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom” or just “Skadden Arps.”
>
While no single method can perfectly disambiguate names all the time, NLP techniques such as named entity recognition and named entity disambiguation – two active areas of research and practice in the NLP community – can help identify the correct names and return the associated documents an attorney is looking for.
>
In today’s data-rich world, litigators, transactional lawyers, and corporate counsel alike need to understand which tools and what technologies will best enable them to sift through vast amounts of data to find the one or two critical documents they need.
>
Although many attorneys will never feel confident in their research, they may sleep easier knowing that their research tools are employing technologies such as NLP and machine learning to help them find that needle in the haystack they are looking for.[^2]

### What is machine learning’s role in legal research?
>
For lawyers, supervised machine learning offers the best of both worlds: faster research than ever, with less risk of inaccuracies or missing documents. The result is nearly instant access to data and insights that can give lawyers a leg up on their competition.
>
By using tools that employ advanced AI techniques, such as supervised machine learning, attorneys can gather insights from large sets of data and focus on the information that matters most, enabling them to be more efficient, more strategic, and offer more value to their clients.
>
**As an example, Bloomberg Law’s [Brief Analyzer](https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/brief-analyzer/) employs machine learning to streamline and reduce the steps in [traditional brief analysis](https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/reports/the-art-of-the-brief/). The Brief Analyzer tool identifies and evaluates legal authorities cited in the brief, suggests relevant content with detailed explanations for the suggestions, and cross-references and links to related resources such as similar briefs and Practical Guidance.**[^2]

>
Brief Analyzer displays the legal brief and related content in an easy-to-review, side-by-side format.
>
B**loomberg Law’s [Draft Analyzer](https://pro.bloomberglaw.com/draft-analyzer/) also uses machine learning to help lawyers compare provisions in their drafts to similarly drafted paragraphs filed in [EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml). The new tool algorithmically analyzes each paragraph from virtually every agreement and organizational document filed as an EDGAR exhibit to show developing consensus among drafters. It first categorizes each paragraph based on textual similarity and constructs one or more unified versions (“composites”) for each identified cluster of similarly worded paragraphs.**[^2]

### 6 current uses of AI in Law
>
**_E-Discovery_.** This was the first use of AI in law and is quite well established. In essence, e-discovery is software that enables a vast number of documents to be surveyed and those relevant to the search criteria to be identified at a fraction of the cost, in a fraction of the time, and generally much more accurately than when the same survey is performed by teams of lawyers or paralegals looking at computer screens.
>
**_Expertise Automation_.** This is the commoditizing of legal knowledge that enables clients (as well as lawyers) to find answers to questions using software developed for particular areas of legal information that once would have required interaction with a lawyer. Examples include software developed to enable individuals to draft a will or enable companies to give their employees access to answers to common questions in a specific area, such as employment law. For example, a factory manager in a jurisdiction can ask the software what rights to family leave a pregnant employee has without the need to speak to a lawyer either within the company’s legal department or its outside counsel. In addition, this is the realm of software increasingly developed to increase access to justice for individuals who do not have the resources to hire a lawyer. These tools include will drafting, and even assisting individuals in litigation contexts such as housing court or fighting traffic tickets.
>
**_Legal Research_.** Publishing companies, like LexisNexis or Westlaw, have huge databases of information including laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. They have developed software packages that enable clients (or lawyers) to do fast, accurate (and therefore cheap) research that would have taken individual lawyers much longer (and more expensively and, probably, less accurately) in earlier times. Some of them even offer services that will do the work of answering questions using the software and providing the solutions directly to clients’ legal departments without an outside lawyer.
>
**_Document Management_.** Corporations often have thousands or tens of thousands of similar documents, such as contracts, that need to be managed for consistency and enforcement. An example was publicized by JP Morgan in 2017. The [Bloomberg.com](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/professional_lawyer/27/1/the-future-law-firms-and-lawyers-the-age-artificial-intelligence/Bloomberg.com) headline read: “JP Morgan Software Does in Seconds What Took Lawyers 360,000 Hours.”[6](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/professional_lawyer/27/1/the-future-law-firms-and-lawyers-the-age-artificial-intelligence/#6) Readers who follow the Artificial Lawyer website[7](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/professional_lawyer/27/1/the-future-law-firms-and-lawyers-the-age-artificial-intelligence/#7) will see almost daily announcements of new software packages designed to assist corporations to accomplish similar outcomes.
>
**_Contract and Litigation Document Analytics and Generation_.** There are now numerous AI tools that help lawyers draft consistent, appropriate, and up-to-date documents both in the transactional and litigation spheres, by reference to huge databases of precedents. In addition, there is a growing group of AI providers that provide what are essentially do-it-yourself tool kits to law firms and corporations to create their own analytics programs customized to their specific needs.
>
**_Predictive Analytics_.** There are two main groups of AI tools that fit within this category. The first are the tools that will analyze all the decisions in a particular sphere, input the specific issues in a case including factors like the individual judge assigned to hear the case, and provide a prediction of likely outcomes. This is the group that the French have recently criminalized[8](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/publications/professional_lawyer/27/1/the-future-law-firms-and-lawyers-the-age-artificial-intelligence/#8) (a decision that seems about as likely to succeed in the long run as the early English king (Canute) who stood at the sea shoe and ordered the tide to turn). The other kind of analytics, of which there are now at least four available in the marketplace, will review a given piece of legal research or legal submission to a court and identify the key relevant precedents and authorities that are missing from the research or submission. In the United States, one of these tools is available for free to judges, which raises the question of whether it is now legal malpractice for lawyers not to use such a tool before filing legal papers with the court.[^3]
