Despite public perception data science is not *big data*, although the rise of big data has greatly advanced the capability of advanced data science capabilities like *machine learning*[^1][^2]

## benefits of more data
In principle *ceteris paribus* more data is always better. It allows room for error, where you can throw out observation and still have an adequate data set. 

More data also allows for the use of more flexible algorithms with less risks of **overfitting** the noise in the data, which means results can express finer gradations of prediction and should be more accurate/precise. [^3]

Indeed as volume of data and number of features have grown, so has the performance of more expressive algorithms [^4]

## drawbacks of more data
However more data isn't a panacea and won't make up for poor data quality [^5] or poorly defined problems/solutions[^6]

Additionally as data volume grows so does the complexity, and working with large datasets becomes more difficult and resource intensive[^6]

Many simpler models and methods work well with smaller data sets, better decision making is often possible with simpler algorithms. [^7]

Goal should be improved decision making and using the right data, not just more complexity. [^8]

Too often big data is often bad data because of how it's generated[^9]
