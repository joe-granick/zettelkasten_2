For strongly typed languages not understanding distinction between data types can lead to  unwitting combinations of incompatible data types[^1] 

Therefore Java has strong data types formally defined by the *finite* set of values that it can store and the set of operations that can be performed on those [^2]

Java has 8 primitive data types built-in
