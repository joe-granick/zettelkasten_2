> "using the data available as substitute for an ideal data set"[^1]

A data scientist won't always have the exact data designed. Taking a data driven over a hypothesis driven approach requires  using the data available to answer the question at hand. This is an especially common constraint with the type of solutions based on "big data"^[[[202206151429c-big data vs. small data]]] 

**Proxy dataset**The ideal dataset often doesn't exist,  may be proprietary, take a great cost of effort time and money to study. However often there may be datasets available tracking similar populations that can be used as a stand-in  or **statistical proxy** ^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 7**]

**Proxy variable**Many times a variable can't be directly measured, instead a variable related to or representative of the variable of interest can be used as a **statistical proxy**. 

Good data scientists need to be pragmatic, and will often make due with the data available instead of being defeated looking for the perfect dataset or variable.
