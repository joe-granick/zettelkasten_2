For a *normal distribution* the standard deviation is very revealing about the characteristics of the dataset.

68% of the data must lie within $1 \sigma$ of the mean

95% of the data must lie within $2 \sigma$ of the mean

99.7% of the data must lie within $3 \sigma$ of the mean

Because of these properties, knowing the mean and standard deviation gives us even more understanding of where to expect observations to fall for normal distributions.
