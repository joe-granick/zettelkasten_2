Probability and statistics are connected and share a vocabulary, but the differences are important to understand.

Probability is a theoretical that studies the mathematics of future events and their likelihood.^[ [[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual 1st]] pg 29]

Statistics is an applied science that deals with reasoning about the data generated by real world observations.^[ [[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual 1st]] pg 29]

Statistics provides the tools to approximate the resulting data in the real world to the rules  and form of the perfect world of probability and measure how closely it resembles that mathematically perfect world. From there the tools of probability can be used to reason about the likelihood of future events given the approximation from the data.
