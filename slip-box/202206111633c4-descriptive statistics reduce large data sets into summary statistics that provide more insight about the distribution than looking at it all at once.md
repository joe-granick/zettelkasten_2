### Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics are reduce large datasets into elements that summarize important properties of the larger dataset.[^1] 

This is form of data reduction as the new elements are derived from the original dataset which is reduced into a set of objects that provide some insight about the larger set. An when taken together provide a lot of information about the underlying distribution that may not be obvious when looking at it as a whole[^1] 
	- mean
	- min
	- max
	- count

These statistics provide a vocabulary for talking and reasoning about aggregate datasets, and can often be useful ass features themselves (summarizing clusters within a dataset).[^1]

Two main types of summary statistics
	- *Central tendency measures*
	- *Variability measures*
#### Central Tendency Measures
[[202206111633c4a-central tendency like mean median and mode describe center of distribution around which data is spread]]

#### Variability Measures
[[202206111633c4b-variability measures describe how far the data is spread around the center]]
