Data Science recently emerged at the intersection of several long established fields.
**computer science** contruibutes machine learning and technology that can deal with data and computation at scale. [[202206111633 - think like a computer scientist act like a statistician understand like a domain expert|DS CS Stats and Domain Experts]]

From **statistics** it takes eploratory data analysis (EDA), significance testing, and visualization techniques. [[202206111633 - think like a computer scientist act like a statistician understand like a domain expert|DS CS Stats and Domain Experts]]

**Application domains** in business in science pose interesting and important problems to solve using the tools of data science and standards for which novel DS solution can be measured against.

These fields are well established, Data Science has gained prominence at their intersection only recently due to three recent trends[^(pg 1)]
1. **Volume and variety of data:** New technology allows generation storage and annotation of much larger complex data sets from sources like social media, sensors and logs. Exploring these data sets encourages new questions and possibilities and creates a perfromance differential for new methods that can perform even more precisely on "big data"[^(pg 1)]
2. **Advances in computing** power allows execution of more complex algorithms and a higher capacity to process and analyze these new massive datasets. Cloud computing democratized access to power to some extents. Adavances in machine learning combined with larger and more complex datasets have foudn data driven solutions to difficult computational problems like *Computer Vision* and *NLP*[^(pg 1)]
3. **Proven solutions across  a variety of applicatiosn domains** Power of modern ML driven analytical solutions have proven their power to the industry and public across a variety of domains. From tech giants like Google and Facebook, hedge funds like Renaissance Technologies and TwoSigma to less obvious domains like managing a baseball team (Sabremetrics) and electionf forecasting (fivethirtyeight)[^(pg 1)]
