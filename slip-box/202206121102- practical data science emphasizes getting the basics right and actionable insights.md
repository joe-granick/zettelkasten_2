To be effective data scientists need the insight and experience to ask the right questions and be able to sense if an approach is moving toward actionable insights^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg vi**]^[[[202206121102a-DS requires context and asking good questions of the dataset|202206121102b]]]

Insights that cannot be acted upon rarely generate value or have lasting influence

Frequently the forest can be missed for the trees when the focus on algorithms is overemphasized by DS practitioners. ^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg vi**]

However throwing more data and more compute at more advanced algorithms won't help if the fundamentals aren't in place ^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg vi**]

The fundamentals underpinning data science include the basics:
	- understanding the context of a problem or application domain ^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg vi**]
	- cleaning data and integrating relevant data sources^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg vi**]
	- communicating results clearly, often to non-technical audiences^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg vi**]
