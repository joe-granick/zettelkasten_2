With new technologies are able to deal with data at a scale previously unheard of. [^(pg 3)]
Things that previously couldn't be measured are now measurable, and things that could be measured are able to measured much more granularly.^[ [[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 3**]

A wider variety of data and new methods are able to handle a variety of data that traditional methods couldn't incorporate because it wasn't structured properly. ^[ [[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 3**]

Datasets can now be in combined in ways previously unimaginable. And scientists can leverage CS tools and DS mindset to amplify signal that previously couldn't be perceived.^[ [[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 3**]

Some of these advances include:
- genome sequencing in biology^[ [[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 3**]
- full sky telescopes in astronomy^[ [[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 3**]

Data scientists use advanced algorithms and measurement technology to work with large datasets and take a **data-driven** approach.[^(pg 3)]

Scientists traditionally take a **hypothesis-driven** but now able to collect data on a larger magnitude can also benefit from being **data -driven**.
