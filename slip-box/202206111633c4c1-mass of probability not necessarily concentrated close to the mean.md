Distributions with the same mean, can have vastly different variances, meaning the range of values to be expected and their frequency of occurrence is unclear.[^1]

For example a light bulb might have a mean working life in hours of $\mu=3000$ where it normally is just as likely to last longer as it is to last a shorter period of time, with the uncertainty measured by $\sigma$. Meanwhile if a manufacture puts an artificial limit on the bulbs where once it hits 3000 hours it shut down, then the mean will still be 3000, but the standard deviation will be 0.[^1]
