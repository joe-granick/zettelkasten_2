*Classification* and *Regression* are the two main taks of *supervised learning, with supervised learning being the main type of predictive task withing data science.*[^1]

Despite on the surface solving different problem types with completely separate type of output, problems of one type can often be recast as another.

Not all problems can be reframed this way, and if the output is an input to something else a numeric or categorical output may be necessary. However where one output can be subtituted for another, a creative data scientist can recast the problem if the output of the initial approach doesn't reach the desired level of accuracy or consistency.

Identification of where reframing will be beneficial as well as appropriate problem casting and recasting depend heavily on undertsanding the context of the problem and the structure of the data and analysis.[^3][^4]

## recasting classification and regression[^2]

| problem framing     |question 1   | question 2  |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| classification | *Will the price of a stock go up tomorrow?*   | *Is selling life insurance to this person a risk?*    |
| regression     | *What will the price of a stock be tomorrow?* | *How many more years will is this person live?* |               |                                                       |                                                     |
