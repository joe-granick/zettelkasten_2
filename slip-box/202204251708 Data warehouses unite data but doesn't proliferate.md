>When we first met Boris, he shared a seemingly simple problem. Let’s say you’re on the Sales team at Figma, and a customer’s account is coming up for renewal. Going into the conversation, you might want to know some facts: How many of their team members are using Figma and how many files have they created and shared? Who are your account champions and power users?
>
But Boris knew finding those answers wasn’t easy. The sales team tracks accounts in a CRM tool, and a product team tracks users in their analytics system. There’s no bridge between the two.
>
And as the Census team dug in, they realized this problem was getting worse. Due to proliferation of SaaS apps, business data was increasingly fragmented. And while data teams were unifying this information in the cloud data warehouse, it wasn’t making its way to CRMs, ERPs, HRIS and more — where it truly mattered.
