## Probability
Probability theory formal framework for reasoning about likelihood of event. The framework is built on a vocabularly for reasoning about uncetrainty/likelihood.[^1]

The vocabulary connects probability to statistics and allows application of the theoretical study of probability to working with uncertainty in real world data. 

Data usually comes from measuring properties of observed events[^2]
Combined probability and statistics provides way of reasoning about the likelihood of  events and the tools to analyze real world data composing these events.[^3]
