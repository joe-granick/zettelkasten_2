For scientist nothing is completely true or false, evidence just points the arrow towards more true or less. Therefore the precision of numbers and number of significant figures are far less important than their directionality and the order of magnitude suggested. ^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg3**]

Computer scientists care about how precisely a number is calculated. To them it is important to be able to calculate significant figures, but the meaning added by the increase in precision is irrelevant.^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg3**]
