Regardless of the distribution at least $1-(1/k^2)$ of mass must be within $\pm k$ standard deviations of the mean.[^1] 

This means for any distribution at least 75% of the observations must be within 2 standard deviations of the mean, and 89% within 3 standard deviations of the mean.[^1]
For symmetric distributions like the *Gaussian* (*normal*) the spread is even tighter.[^2]
