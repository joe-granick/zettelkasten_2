The way google maps and yelp display information is ideally what should be ahcieved through [[operational analytics]]

Today companies attempt to be data driven by deploying complex dashboards brimming with metrics.

Often relevant info is lost at sea

Even if it can be found, referencing info requires additional complications in workflow, context switching can lead to decrease in performance

Yelp and google on the other hand present the relevant data about the restaruant in order to make decisions about where to eat. Well designed users instinctively know how to reference this information to decide whether they will have a good experience. ([[score interpretation]] interpretation still requires more nuance than would be instinctive for most). This empirical data replaces what would have normally been satisfisced by unreliable gossip from firends, or intuition. The likelihood of a having a good time could now be guarenteed on a more consistent basis, no need to fumble through charts, tables and KPIs to get ther, and far more preferable to the alternative going from the gut.
