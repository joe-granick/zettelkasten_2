## supervised learning
The most common problems in data science are of prediction. 
**Supervised learning** consists of the algorithms used to solve the problems of prediction. The types of predictive problems are categorized as **classification** and **regression.**^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 16**]

### classification
Classification problems attempt to predict the label an observation belongs to from a finite set of discrete labels. ^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 16**]
Examples may include:
	- Predicting which team will win a sporting event^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 17**]
	- Identifying the genre a movie belongs to^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 17**]
	- Predicting whether someone will default on a loan^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 17**]

### regression
Regression problems involve predicting the futures level of a numerical quantity expected from an observation, typically as a function of past outcomes and relevant variables of the feature vector.^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 17**] 
Examples may include:
	- Predicting someone's weight.^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 17**]
	- Predicting amount of snowfall next year.^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 17**]

Even though classification and regression are distinct categories of problems with their own of methods, regression problems can often be recast as classification problems and vice-versa. Proper framing and the ability to reframe highlight the importance of understanding the context of the problem, and the fundamentals of data analysis.^[[[202206161754a1-regression and classification problems can typically be recast as the other|202206161754a1]]]
