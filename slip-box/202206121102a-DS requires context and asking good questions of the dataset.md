Data scientists are typically working on problems that are in a separate field of expertise, and most problems require context to define and build a solution.

Data scientists therefore need to be able to adapt knowledge broadly across fields in order to be able to contextualize unfamiliar subjects, and speak productively with domain experts.^[ [[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 4**]

Real datasets are scarce in the wild, and data scientists need to ask good questions of the data to formulate effective solutions that make sense in the context of the problem domain. ^[ [[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 4**]

Often an answer or solution may lie in datasets that were intended for a completely unrelated purpose. ^[[[202206121102b1-broad thinking is needed to find answers in unexpected data sets|202206121102b]]]

Imagination and the ability to interrogate datasets is crucial to finding the answers because the perfect dataset doesn't exist. ^[ [[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 4**]


Types of questions to ask:
- What might you be able to learn from a given dataset? ^[ [[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 4**]

- What do you/your people really want to know about the world?^[ [[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 4**]

- What will it mean if you find out?^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 4**]
