## supervised learning
The most common problems in data science are of prediction. 
**Supervised learning** consists of the algorithms used to solve the problems of prediction. The types of predictive problems are categorized as **classification** and **regression.**[^1]

### classification
Classification problems attempt to predict the label an observation belongs to from a finite set of discrete labels. [^1]
Examples may include:
	- Predicting which team will win a sporting event[^2]
	- Identifying the genre a movie belongs to[^2]
	- Predicting whether someone will default on a loan[^2]

### regression
Regression problems involve predicting the futures level of a numerical quantity expected from an observation, typically as a function of past outcomes and relevant variables of the feature vector.[^2] 
Examples may include:
	- Predicting someone's weight.[^2]
	- Predicting amount of snowfall next year.[^2]

Even though classification and regression are distinct categories of problems with their own of methods, regression problems can often be recast as classification problems and vice-versa. Proper framing and the ability to reframe highlight the importance of understanding the context of the problem, and the fundamentals of data analysis.[^3]
