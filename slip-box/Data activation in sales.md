>In sales personalization is key. Reaching out at the right time with the right context almost always yields a positive result. Knowing exactly what actions a customer is taking directly within the product and understanding the actions that same customer is taking across marketing channels is extremely difficult. In many [product-led-growth](https://hightouch.io/blog/plg-crm/) (PLG) companies, it’s typical for a customer to sign up for a free trial, create a new workspace, invite additional coworkers, etc. Without the proper context, it’s impossible for sales reps to expand upon that initial use case and increase product adoption. In order to truly offer value to the customer, sales reps need to have the proper context around the entire customer journey.

>With Reverse ETL powering Data Activation, the rich customer data that lives in the warehouse can be synced directly to CRMs like Salesforce and Hubspot, giving sales teams full visibility over every action the customer is taking. One of the best ways to do this is by leveraging a lead scoring model defined in the warehouse or by capturing specific events/actions and syncing them to the end destination every time the data updates within the warehouse. This same information can also be sent to dedicated Slack channels to notify account owners with real-time insights about specific customer actions, whether that be signing up for a free trial, viewing a specific page, or downloading a piece of marketing content.

>A common example of Operational Analytics is often found within SaaS companies leveraging a freemium model. New users can sign up and use the product up to a certain limit, at which point they then have to pay.
>
Product usage data is captured in a BI dashboard and used to track the number of signups, the percentage of users who convert to a paid account, and the effectiveness of sales reps in converting those customers. Sales reps who spend more time personalizing their outreach towards a specific use case usually yield better results.
>
To personalize on an individual level, salespeople have to track down this information across a variety of systems like Slack, Salesforce, etc. With Operational Analytics, the same data that is feeding into a BI dashboard is automatically synced into a CRM like Salesforce. This means that contact and account records are enriched to show whether or not the user is fully onboarded, their last login date, and the user's integrations. This leaves the sales team more time to help existing customers and crack into new accounts.

This isn't a hypothetical example. It's exactly how [Retool used Hightouch](https://hightouch.io/customers/retool) for Operational Analytics. Once Retool began using analytics not just for reporting, but for action, they saw some pretty staggering results, including a **32% increase in reply rate** on emails, as well as a **500% increase in click rate** and increased feature adoption.
