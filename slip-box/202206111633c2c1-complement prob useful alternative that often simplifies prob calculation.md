Often when there are many outcome probabilities to include in the calculation of an event probability, when compared to the total number of outcomes in the sample space.[^1]

When this is the case it is simpler to calculate the probability of the set complement instead and subtract it from the total probability ($p(S)=1$)  [^2]

probability of event calculated from the complement of the event *complement of event denoted*[^1]
$$P(E) = 1 - P(\bar E)$$
