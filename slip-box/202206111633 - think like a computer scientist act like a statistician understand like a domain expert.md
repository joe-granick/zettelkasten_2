>"Think like a computer scientist but act like a statistician"[^1]

Data science links computer science with statistics and domain specilaists/subject matter experts. Each domain has distinct tools and philosphies when approaching problems, good data scientists will incorporate tools from several domains, as no one discipline has a monopoly on the truth, and different areas offer different approaches which may work better, or combine to make a betetr whole solution.[^1]

Data scientists need to recononcile differences between various disciplines and create a coherent approach to a problem

**Computer Science** provides algorithmic methods of data, that work at the scale of modern data, allow predicvtion on much more detailed sets of data, allowing more accuratwe and responsive predictions. Machine Learning one of primary conrtibutions, provides scale. 

Algorithmic thinking should be empahsized as well, as it is helpful in structurng problems, and understanding what form a solution can take

**Statistics** traditionally has much more rigorous treatment of data than computer science, this respect for data and methods of statistical reasoning are also foundational to data science. Data scientists need to go beyond the algorithmic tools/focus on scale from CS but also the core values of statistics including the undertsanding of the application domain, appreciation for the principles of small data, value of significance and an intellectual curiosity and exploratioon fo the data [^1]
**Domain Experts** are critical to undertsanding the context of the problem. Theiur contextual understanding is crucial to translating the problem into data analytics solution. Further their expertise can help with assumptions built into features and how outputs should be structured when solutions require hiearchies of models[^1]

Data scientists therefore need to be able to collaborate across disciplines in order to define and translate problems from various domains into inot ones for which analytical tools can be applied.
