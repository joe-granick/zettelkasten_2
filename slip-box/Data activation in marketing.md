## Topic
>For the most part, marketing teams are focused on two key results, conversions and impressions. This is normally measured by CPI (cost per impression) and CAC (customer acquisition cost) within ads platforms like Google, Facebook, TikTok, etc. Building custom audiences and uploading audience segments to ad platforms for marketing purposes is challenging. Launching campaigns should be easy but marketing teams are forced to go to the data team every time they want to experiment with a new target audience (ex: customers who signed up but havenâ€™t used the app in the last 30 days).

>Since this type of customer data is only available in the warehouse, data teams are forced to export ad-hoc datasets, and marketing teams are forced to upload these same datasets to their different ad platforms. Data stored in a CSV file becomes stale really quickly though, so this process has to be repeated individually for every single campaign. With Data Activation, this is no longer the case because audiences built in the warehouse can be synced directly to ad platforms, giving marketing teams actionable intelligence to create personalized experiences and deliver relevant advertising. Better yet the same audiences can be duplicated to multiple destinations.

>Since most marketers don't know SQL, it can often be challenging to access the customer data that exists within the warehouse. As a workaround to this problem, data analysts are forced to deliver various datasets to marketing teams in the form of a CSV, and data engineers are tasked with building net new data pipelines for every single business tool whether it be a CRM like Salesforce, an Ad platform like Google, or a product analytics platform like Amplitude.
>
Even worse, engineering typically has a backlog of other more important priorities to address, so it can take a substantial amount of time to deliver data to marketing and by the time it is made available the customer or prospect is already at a different point in their journey.
>
With Operational Analytics, data is synced in real-time, enabling marketing teams to improve customer experiences by sending lifecycle marketing campaigns to customers across any channel as soon as they take an action (example: abandoning a shopping, creating a workspace, downloading a whitepaper, etc.) They can also increase ROAS by retargeting customers who visited a pricing page and exclude customers who already purchased.
>
Additionally, they can identify high-value customers by creating lookalike audiences and also send conversion events to different ad networks to optimize targeting and customer acquisition costs. Best of all, marketing teams don't have to wait around for engineering to give them access to the data they need to run their campaigns. Instead, they can rapidly experiment and iterate.
