Computer Scientists tend to focus on **methods**. Topics of concern tend to revolve around algorithmic efficiency, which programming languages are best suited to a problem , and what programs are better. The focus is on the method manipulating the data, but the actual make up of the dataset input is largely irrelevant beyond how it's structure is suited for the method. [ [[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 2**]

In contrast scientists place a large emphasis on the **data** itself. Large amount of effort is involved in collecting data relevant to the problem at hand or question of interest. They build special measurement instruments to collect specific data, spend time and effort tending to experiments,  think hard about what data is needed and how to get it.
