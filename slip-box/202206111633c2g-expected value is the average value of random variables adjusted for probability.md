#### Expected Value
The $\text{expected value of a random variable, denoted E(V), defined in sample space S}$ is: [^1]
$$E(V) = \sum_{s \in S}p(s)V(s)$$
A generalization of the weighted average[^2] it is the average value of all possible values weighted by the sum probability of theory associated outcomes.
