The *arithmetic mean* does a poor job of characterizing non-symmetric distributions as it is extremely sensitive to outliers.[^1]

For example a distribution of wealth or income would be poorly characterized by the *arithmetic mean*. The wealth of Bill Gates has an outsized effect on the result, and the resulting average income does a poor job of describing the average citizen's income.[^1]

A better approach is to use the *median*, as the addition of Bill Gates will move the median much, as it is just the value of the centermost point in the distribution[^1]

The *median* will be close to the *arithmetic mean* for symmetric distributions, but will be very different for skewed ones like power law and exponential distribution.[^1]

In these case the *median* is a better representation of the average observation. It may be of interest to note how far apart the mean and median are in a dataset.[^1]
