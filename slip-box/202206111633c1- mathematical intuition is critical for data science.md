Understanding the mathematics underlying data science, particularly **[[statistics]]** and **[[linear algebra]]** is critical to an intuitive understanding of what methods will work and why?[^1]

**Linear Algebra** important to understand matrix manipulations[^1]

**Statistics** understand framing problems as proof through *[[reducto ad absurdum]]* arguments[^1]
