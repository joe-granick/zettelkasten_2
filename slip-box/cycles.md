## cycles
- graphs can have **cycles** where nodes (*vertices*) reference (*edges*) each other cyclically
- one of two contstraints that differentiate trees from other graphs is that the nodes  of a tree cannot have cycles [[all trees are graphs not all graphs are trees|all trees are graphs]]
	- trees are acyclic graphs where all nodes make up a [[connected graph|connected]]
