Computer Science provides advanced algoirthms to work and process data sets, but not necessarily the meaning of the results once processed.

Science provides to the tools to study the meaning of the results of data, and is therfore puts much more emphasis on the data itself. 

Data science should utilize the tools of computer science with the mindset of a scientist. Therefore data science should treat data like real science, in contrast to CS in the following ways resemble real science over computer science across the following dimensions[^1]
