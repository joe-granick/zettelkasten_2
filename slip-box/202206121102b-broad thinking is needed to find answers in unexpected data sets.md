>The key is thinking broadly: the answers to big, general questions often lie buried in highly-specific data sets, which were no means designed to contain them

Finding the answer to specific problems requires exploring datasets and asking good questions of them. ^[[[202206121102a-DS requires context and asking good questions of the dataset|202206121102a]]]

Often times the dataset needed for the specific question doesn't exist, at least not directly. Imagination and broad thinking will typically be required to find the answers, as they will often be hiding in datasets never intended for the problem at hand. ^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 5**]
