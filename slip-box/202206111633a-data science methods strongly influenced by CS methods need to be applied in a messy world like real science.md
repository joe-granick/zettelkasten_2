Data Science lies on spectrum from Computer Science to "Real" Science. The focus of DS is to turn numbers into insight like real scientists.^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 3**]


Computer scientists produce systems while data scientists produce insights.^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 3**]

While many methods are driven by advancements in computer science, data scientists have to apply thier tools in a messy applications domain. Computer Scientists deal with perfect worlds that they create while real scientists have to deal with the complexities of a chaotic world, thus it is important for DS to take a **scientific mindset** to problems.^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 2**] 

In support of this data science need to approach problems like scientists, with a focus on **why** while leveraging methods from computer science to answer the question of **how** ^[[[Skiena-The Data Science  Design Manual 1st|The Data Science Design Manual]] **pg 2-3**] 
	- this is similarly related to making sure the fundamentals are covered before using complex methods^[[[202206111633a3-scientists benefit from being data-driven like data scientists]]]

**[[202206111633a2c-Computer Science provides tools to work with data while science provides the tools to interpret data|Computer Science provides tools to work with data while science provides the tools to interpret data]]**
**Therefore:** Data science should resemble real science over computer science across the with respect to how data is treated, and leverage the CS tools to work with the data in new ways that cant be accomplished with traditional tools and approaches 

Conversely real scientists benefit from thinking like data scientists as well.^[[[202206111633a3-scientists benefit from being data-driven like data scientists]]]
