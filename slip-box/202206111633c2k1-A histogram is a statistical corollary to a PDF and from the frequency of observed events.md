A *histogram* is a statistical tool strongly related to *PDFs*, whereas the *PDF* represents the likelihood of the next observation being a particular value a *histogram* counts the frequency of an observed value.[^1]

For representative clarity the value ranges might be bucketed into a range of values (particularly if the value range is continuous rather than discrete).[^2]

It is produced by graphing the values of observed values (or bucketed value ranges) on the $x-axis$ and a count of the frequency of occurrence of each value is represent on the $y-axis$.[^4]


The *PDF* of observed events can be approximated by the *histogram*[^3]
