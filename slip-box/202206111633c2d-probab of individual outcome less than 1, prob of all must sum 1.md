#### Probability of an Outcome
The $\text{probability of outcome s, denoted } p(s)$ is the number of times an outcome will occur relative to the entire $\text{sample space } S$ . [^1]
For the *ouctome probability* $p(s)$:
	- Each outcome $s$ in sample space $S$ $0 \le p(s) \le 1$[^1]
	- Sum of probabilities of all outcomes $p(s)$ in $S$ must sum to 1 $\sum _{s\in S}p(s) = 1$[^1]

For two normal dice the probaility of any individual outcome $p(s)$ in set of all outcomes $s \in S$  is $p(s) = (1/6) \times (1/6$) [^1]
