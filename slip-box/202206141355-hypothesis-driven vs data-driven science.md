**Hypothesis-driven** science starts with the specific questions or ideas about the world. Experiments are then designed around proving or disproving the hypothesis and generationg or collecting the evidence (data) needed to do this. [^1]

**Data-driven** science changes the focus toward generating and collecting data at scale and with a fine granularity then genrating questions and finding answers hidden within the data.[^1]

Each approach can augment the other, and both are important to Data Science and increasingly real Science:
>**Hypothesis-driven:** given a problem, what available data will help answer it?[^1]
>**Data-driven:** given a data set, what interesting problems can wee apply it to?[^1]
