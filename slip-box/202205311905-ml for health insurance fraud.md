>Health care fraud costs about [$300 billion](https://www.nhcaa.org/tools-insights/about-health-care-fraud/the-challenge-of-health-care-fraud/) annually in the US. Since health insurance accounts for one-third of healthcare spending, we can roughly say that health insurance fraud costs about $100 billion per year. That’s a huge amount, and as we discussed in our article on [insurance pricing](https://research.aimultiple.com/insurance-pricing/), fraud becomes a burden on customers in the form of higher premiums. [So effective insurance fraud detection](https://research.aimultiple.com/insurance-fraud-detection/ "So effective insurance fraud detection") benefits all with the exception of fraudsters.

>AI models can be effective [fraud detectors and preventers](https://research.aimultiple.com/ai-fraud-detection/) as they automate manual workflows. Health insurers generate a huge amount of paperwork by processing claims. Traditionally, insurers manually review the relevance of claims to determine whether or not they are fraudulent. This was both a time-consuming and inefficient process. According to [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/artificial-intelligence-in-health-insurance-smart-claims-management-with-self-learning-software), for every 10 health claims submitted, insurers classify up to 7 as unusual, meaning potentially false or fraudulent, based on company policies. Thus, 70% of the claims are reinvestigated by the insurers.

>According to [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/insights-intelai/2019/02/11/can-ai-cure-what-ails-health-insurance/?sh=19c8fed2d59e) because of this inefficiency of manual fraud detection, investment in AI-based fraud detection is the top priority of firms. [NLP-based models](https://research.aimultiple.com/nlp-insurance/) reduce the time required to identify suspicious case claims by 75%. NLP models are feeded by dataset of previous fraudulent claims and by time become more effective fraud detectors. Thus, they can reduce the unrealistic 70% rate of suspicious cases.
