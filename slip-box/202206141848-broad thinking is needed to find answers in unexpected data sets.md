>The key is thinking broadly: the answers to big, general questions often lie buried in highly-specific data sets, which were no means designed to contain them

Finding the answer to specific problems requires exploring datsets and asking good questions of them. [^1]

Often times the dataset needed for the specific question doesn't exist, at least not directly. Imagination and broad thinking will typically be required to find the answers, as they will often be hiding in datasets never intended for the problem at hand. [^2]
