#### Event
An $\text{event } E$ is a susbet of outcomes from an experiment that all have the same result from the point of view of what the experiment is testing. [^1]

If the dice rolling experiment is a game of craps the events are a win or a loss. For a win the roll needs to be a 7 or 11, so any outcome where the two dice sum to 7 or 11 represent the same event of winning.

The conditions that win a craps game are the subset of outcomes below[^1]
$$E = \{(1,6),(2,5),(3,4),(4,3),(5,2),(6,1),(5,6),(6,5)\}$$
