>Ultimately, I think AI-driven health insurance can deliver better outcomes and may also be able to address some of the longstanding complexities of the U.S. healthcare system. When faced with a rise in expectation and complex healthcare standards, consumers and providers can become overwhelmed in an industry that often lacks simplicity. Through the use of technology and machine learning, buying healthcare no longer has to be undermined through expenses and frustration. With better understanding of each consumer’s problems, the root of their problems and their unique healthcare needs, AI and machine learning can provide a guiding, innovative solution that simplifies the industry, organizes data and ultimately helps improve patient safety and outcomes.
