## Chapter 2:
Topic:
**four types of reading** {pgs: 18 -21}
1. elementary- understanding what a sentence or book says
2. inspectional- learning the most about a book in a limited amount of time by systematically skimming the structure and content
3. analytical- understanding the most amount about a work in an unlimited amount of time through careful qeustioning of the material
4. syntoptical- placing the work in the context of other works using the related corpus to develop new insights

- each type of reading contains the previous level and increases complexity
- [[reading for understanding]] involves more of the levels than [[reading for information]] or reading for [[entertainment]]
- reading for understanding is critical to actually learning and not just memorizing an argument
