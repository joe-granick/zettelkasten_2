Statistics can help us measure things that previously would have been unrealistic to measure. Using methods of statistical analysis we can infer some information (although not perfect information) from the following unobserved populations:^[ [[How to Measure Anything]] **pg 42**]
- *[[8a1a measuring with small random samples of a large population]]*:
- *[[8a1b measuring the size of a mostly unobserved population]]*:
- *[[8a1c measuring when there are many variables involved (potentially including unknown variables)]]:*
- **[[8a1d measuring the risk of rare events]]:*
- *[[8a1e measuring subjective preferences and values]]:*
