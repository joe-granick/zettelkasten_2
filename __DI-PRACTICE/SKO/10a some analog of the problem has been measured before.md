Most problems aren't actually unique. Even if a measurements seems different with it's own complex idiosyncrasies, usually the measurements are approachable with standard methods and tools. ^[[[How to Measure Anything]] **pg 59**]

Executives should act similar to academics who research to see if measures of problems have already been formulated from previous research. Not every measurement needs to start from scratch (few do). ^[[[How to Measure Anything]] **pg 59**]

Knowledge of a breadth of domains helps recognize where measurements in another field are mathematically similar and can be translated to the domain in which the problem exists. ^[[[How to Measure Anything]] **pg 59**]
