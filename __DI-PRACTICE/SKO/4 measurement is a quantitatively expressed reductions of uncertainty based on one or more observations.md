For decision making a measurement of an observation doesn't need to eliminate uncertainty it only needs to reduce it to be useful ^[ [[How to Measure Anything]] pg 31]

No measure will be perfect and will be subject to some level of noise and error. When something is measure, the certainty of that measure lies on a spectrum of probability^[ [[How to Measure Anything]] pg 31]
	- real scientific methods report ranges of values and level of uncertain ty
	- lack of expressed uncertainty may indicate that no empirical methods were used and it is not actually a measurement

Whether or not it is valuable to measure depends on the economic factors of how valuable the reduction in uncertainty is, how often the decision is made, and the cost of actually acquiring the measurement.
