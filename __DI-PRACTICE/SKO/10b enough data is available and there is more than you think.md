Typically the only way you will be limited by a lack of data is if you're only willing to use direct answers and measures (and that indirect evidence of the phenomenon of interest has no information value). ^[[[How to Measure Anything]] **pg 60**]

Limit is usually due to the [[10b2 uniqueness fallacy]], but even though other situations may not be a perfect mirror, it is an improvement of uncertainty. There are often principles and models that generalize. 
	- When insurance agencies interpolate risk from related variables ^[ [[10b1 examples of indirect measurements]]], they may be inaccurate for certain instances, but over a portfolio of policy holders they are able to set favorable rate. Similarly for most decisions, we can consider them part of a portfolio of decisions where we are trying to optimize for the risk/reward trade off of the decisions and mix of decisions ^[ [[10b3 optimizing a portfolio of decisions]]]

Experience and must be based on historical observations just like statistical models. If every event is so unique that nothing from past events could possibly be informative in a statistical model, must also mean nothing can be learned from past experiences, so all experience is irrelevant. ^[ [[How to Measure Anything]] **pg 61**]

Large variety of data sources also exist now that are easily accessible ^[ [[10b4 technology enabled sources of data]]]
