## Math Forms the Foundation of Data Science 
A base level of undertsanding of the mathematical foundation of data science is necessary before insight can be extracted from numerical data to produce rigorus conclusions and trustworthy results[^1]

#### elaborate
 Need to know what assumptions go into model

 Need to know how to translate a real world phenomenon into a representative numerical model, that adequately captures the critcal variables of interest

Need to know nuances of the set of numbers making up a variable to undertand it's meaning for the phenomenon, and how that translates to a model

Need to know how algorithms and models work from a mathematical perspective to understand limitations, and how they may be adjusted

### Probability
Probability provides the formal framework for reasoning about likelihood and uncertainty with a vocabularly that conects the theory to the applied science of statistics[^2] 


### Statistics

### Linear Algebra

### Calculus

### Information Theory
