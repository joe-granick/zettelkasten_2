Assignment statement represent action performed in Java that associate a variable *identifier* with a value to store. It is how Java represent the initialization or change of value at the associated memory address.^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]]**pg 17**]

Before a value can be assigned to variable it's data type must be initialized by a declaration statement^[[202207150859-declaration statements are how variables are created in Java|202207150859]]

Valid assignment statements can only consist of one variable while the left hand side can be made up of a literal, another variable or any  expression that produces a value as long as the data-type is compatible with the variable being assigned the value.^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]]**pg 17**]
