Data scientists are typically working on problems that are in a separate field of expertise, and most problems require context to define and build a solution.

Data scientists therefore need to be able to adapt knowledge broadly across fields in order to be able to conetxualize unfamiliar subjects, and speak productively with domain experts.[^1]

Real datasets are scarce in the wild, and data scientists need to ask good questions of the data to formulate effective solutions that make sense in the context of the problem domain. [^1]

Often an answer or solution may lie in datasets that were intended for a completely unrelated purpose. [^2]

Imagination and the ability to interrogate datasets is crucial to finding the answers because the perfect dataset doesn't exist. [^1]

Types iof questions to ask:
- What might you be able to learn from a given dataset? [^1]
- What do you/your people really want to know about the world?[^1]
- What will it mean if you find out?[^1]
