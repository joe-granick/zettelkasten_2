A variable needs space allocated and a name associated with it, and in Java the variable type needs to specified as Java needs to reserve enough space to store the finite set of values in that data-type.^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]]**pg 16**]

The name allows the program to refer to the variable later on by providing a handle associated with the memory address where the value is stored.^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]]**pg 16**]

The actual declaration is made up of the data-type and the variable name, but not necessarily a value or calculation because this is meant to reserve the appropriate space and save the address for future reference, but not necessarily provide a value to be stored at that address ^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]]**pg 16**]

Multiple variables can be declared in the same statement^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]]**pg 16**]
`int a,b c;`

For efficiency variables can be declared and initialized in the same expression.^[[[202207181227- variables can be declared and initialized at same time for efficiency|202207181227]]]
