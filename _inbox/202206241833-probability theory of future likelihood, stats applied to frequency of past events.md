Probability and statistics are connected and share a vocabularly, but the differences are important to understand.

Probability is a theoretical that studies the mathematics of future events and their likelihood.[^1]

Statistics is an applied science that deals with reasoning about the data genrated by real world observations.[^1]

Statistics provides the tools to approximate the resulting data in the real world to the rules  and form of the perfect world of proobaility and measure how closely it resembles that mathematically perfect world. From there the tools of probabilty can be used to reason about the likelihood of future events given the approximation from the data.
