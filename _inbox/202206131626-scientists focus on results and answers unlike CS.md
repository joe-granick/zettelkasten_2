Scientists place an importance of the **results** of their work with data. They are using data to answer questions and understand how the world works, the results are important because they want to know what the meaning is.[^1]

For computer scientists the focus is placed on the **computation** or operation performed on the data, but the result isn't so important as long as it is done correctly. Indeed since the objective is not concerned with the meaning of the result, bad computer scientists are fine with a result as long as it looks right. [^1]
