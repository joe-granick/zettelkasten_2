*Correlation* measures the variability of a random variable with respect to another one, describing how much they move with each other.

The *correlation* defined within $r(X,Y)$ with range $[-1,1]$ measure the degree to which random variable $X$ is a linear function of $Y$ and vice versa.[^1]

The larger the magnitude of the correlation the coefficient the more strongly related the variables are. With a correlation of 1 being *perfectly correlated* and -1 being perfectly *anti-correlated*.[^1]

The stronger this relationship the correlation relationship the more accurately we can predict one variable from the other. This is why correlation between observed variables serves as the basis for predictive models. And *anti-correlations* are just as useful for prediction, as the strength of the relationship is the same, but in the opposite directions [^1][^2] 

Two main types of correlation are the *Pearson correlation* and the *Spearman rank correlation*[^3]
