To use a variable in programs the *data-type* needs to be declared ^[[[202207150859-declaration statements are how variables are allocated space in Java|202207150859]]] and assigned an initial value to store which can be manipulated in expressions later on ^[[[202207150901- expressions compute new values by combining entities like formulas in math|202207150901]]]

For concise code the declaration and initialization can be done in the same statement, this is known as **inline initialization** ^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]] **pg 18**]

`int a = 1234;`
