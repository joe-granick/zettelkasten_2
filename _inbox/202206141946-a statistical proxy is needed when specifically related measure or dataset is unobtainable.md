**Proxy dataset**The ideal dataset often doesn't exist,  may be proprietary, take a great cost of effort time and money to study. However often there may be datasets available tracking similiar populations that can be used as a stand-in  or **statistical proxy** [^1]

**Proxy variable**Many times a variable can't be directly measured, insetad a variable realted to or representative of the variable of interest can be used as a **statistical proxy**. 

good data scientists need to be pragmatic, and will often make due with the data available instead of being defeated looking for the perfect dataset or variable.
