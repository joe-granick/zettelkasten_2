## Data Science for Business
- study by economist [[Erik Brynjolfsson]] in 2011 found data driven firms more productive to a statistically significant degree [^1] [^2] [^3]
- Data driven decision making (DDD) is the practice of making decisions based on an analysis of available data rather than on intuition [^1] 
- DDD is not all or nothing and can be combined with intuition and other approaches to decision making [^1]
- study by economist [[Erik Brynjolfsson]] in 2011 found data driven firms more productive to a statistically significant degree [^1][^2][^3]
	-  SD 4% - 6%
- study also found high correlation with other measures in an apparently causal manner [^2][^3]
	- ROE
	- ROA
	- asset utilization
	- market value
- two types of decisions enhanced by data analysis
	1. decisions for which discoveries need to be made within data
	2. decisions that repeat, ideally at a large scale so that small increases in decision making accuracy yield large returns
- predictive models abstract away details of world to focus on subset of factors correlated with a quantity of interest

## Chapter 1 Introduction- Data-Analytic Thinking: 
Topic:
**7-8:** DS benefits from access to big data, but data processing and engineering isn't DS itself

**9:** Big data vs small data DS is like Web 1.0 vs. Web 2.0

## Chapter 3 Introduction to Predictive Modeling- From Correlation to Supervised Segmentation: 
Topic:

**49-62:** Entropy and information gain

## Chapter 10 Representing and Mining Text:
**252-253:** text data is considered unstructured, it is not structred in the standardized way we would work with data (like in a table or relational databse), it has has linguistic structure but that require context.
