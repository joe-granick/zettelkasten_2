##### Q. What are benefits of Reverse ETL from an executive persepective [00:50]
- biggest beneift being able to do things with data themselves
- data is already there, they're just getting access to that data and the ability to take action on it
- two levels
	1. core baseline being able to see that data at the right time (salesforce being able to see) surfacing those metrics where the user actually lives
	2. after they have the data they can now put automations on it (
		- automatically generating invoices based on consumption metrics
		- automatically notify sales counterpart that client stopped lohging in and should go check on them
		- this automation can only be built where user already feels comfortable with tool

##### Q.  How does operational analytics reduce context switching [02:32]
- definitely benefit for data user and business user
	- business user 
		- doesn't have to worry about where data is coming from, they can know that as data changes they will be up to date
		- instead of having to worry about what table or report to look for data, relevant data is persitently available
		- provides peace-of-mind
	- data user
		- data teams previously bogged down writing SQL queries for the rest of the organization
		- essentially functioned as ticket taking IT orgs
		- now they can build data products in the form of models and pipelines
		- now instead of business users asking questions all the time, they are empowering the business users to find those answers themselves
		- work can now be focused into the product instead of scattered across ad-hoc requests

##### Q.  How does operational analytics affect cost of storage [05:50]
- Additionalu cost of storing data is low, but exists
- Much lower than if a CDP were used
	- Data stored in warehouse
	- Then double stored in CDP
	- Then CDP replicates into downstream tool
- With CDP data is tored in 3 places, Reverse ETL cuts out an intermediary by using the DW as the CDP
- Saves a significant amount of money, because the data warehouse now acts as the CDP
	- significant saving
	- regardless need data stored in channel tool, because marketer only knows that channel tool
	- channel tool has real time capabilities to manage
	- cutting out doubke storage in CDP
	- if anything were saving money
- is warehouse going to be charged more?
	- analysis showed that typically it's only an increase of 1% in warehouse cost

##### Q. What type of companies will beenefit form OA and at what  level of maturity and what types of problems [07:55]
- Infrastructure
	- Data warehouse
	- pipelines for getting into data warehouse
	- clean transformed data in the data warehouse
	- spend 6 month to set up dat warehouse, get data into dw, and transform into clean models
	- then your simply selecting existing models 
	- now when models are update they are acutomatically reflected
- maturity
	- have a data hire
	- data warehouse 100+ employees
	- until you have data hire probably will benefit more from off the shelf SaaS tools and Reverse ETL
- strong reasonms for adopting OA
	1. save a significant amount of money without CDP
	2.  now can freely get data into tools and not worry about ELT, transofmring when see fit
		1. now on unified data store
- can be on prem, only need some sort of relational database

##### any additional thought ? [18:00]
- operational analytics should be called data activation
	- operational analytics confusing term
	- you have your data, now what do you do with it
	- job of BI/Analytics should be to activate data
	- activation - what data is actually used in the wild
- b2b vs. b2c etl
	- works equallyu well for both equally
	- take revenue genration teams and empower them with data and see what happens
	- revenue generatinmg teams make more money when empowered with data through reverse etl
	- now analytics teams can point directly to revenue generation
	- analytics now powers these teams work
	- can use to power customer outreach workflow
- instead of scheduled outrach can now reach ouit when customer has gone over usage


#### S&P Research Request
>
Hi, Team.
>
We just hung up with S&P and had Scott Davis and team on the call. We’d like to have an internal discussion on how we can help them with emerging technologies and the art of the possible for their initiatives.
>
Here’s a high level overview of the meeting:
•  Mike: SPSS for survey data, syndicated surveys/repeatable in market intelligence, 100 per year
	- SPSS to analyze the data and get into right form
	- Generate cross-tabs and PPT presentation to deliver to clients
	- Look for complimentary data to go along with surveys
	- Morphing into this role
	- *How can we take the data we have and add other sources to add value*
	- Services internal group of analysts (multiple topics, cyber, AI/ML, etc.) for the analysts writing articles on what's happening, future, etc.
		- Cross-tabs compare answers from surveys
		- Analysts take the data and write about it for their customers
		- Would probably be interested in ThoughtSpot for analysts
		- Looking at Workbench? Uses python to pull data into Tableau (might be opportunity to automate the process with Alteryx for example
>
•  Maurice - introduce us to others, send papers, Horizon report
	- Looking for opportunities in contracts, partners
	- *ContractAI*
	- *SpendAI*
	- *Just purchased IHS Market - could use ContractAI for that*
