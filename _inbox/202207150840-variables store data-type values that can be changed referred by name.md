Variables provide a way to store a value along with a name which can be referred to by a program's code. ^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]]**pg 16**]

A *Declaration statement*  creates  a variable ^[[[202207150859-declaration statements are how variables are allocated space in Java|202207150859]]] and an *expression* can utilize variables for computation along with other entities ^[[[202207150901- expressions compute new values by combining entities like formulas in math|202207150901]]]

In Java a variable is initialized with a data-type and can only store values from the finite set included in said data-type.^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]]**pg 16**]

After initialization a variable can be assigned a value. ^[[[202207161151- assignemnt statement associates variables with values they store|202207161151]]]

Variables can be changed by the program over the course of the execution of the program^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]]**pg 16**]
