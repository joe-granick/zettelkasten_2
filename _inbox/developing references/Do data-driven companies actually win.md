## Do data-driven companies actually win?
https://benn.substack.com/p/do-data-driven-companies-win?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email

- whether data has positive impact is too low of a bar, "how much better does data make us?"
> -Or, to put it another way, if weâ€™re competing against companies that have more experience, are more decisive, have better instincts, or operate more crisply than we do, can data cover these gaps?

- good data analytics is **like counting cards** 
	- effect is aggregate over time
- **implications:**
	1. Can't judge effectiveness based on strategic decisions
	2. Data need to play the long-game
	3. Using Data Effectively requires using data a lot
- Data teams add most value by keeping teams constantly aware and informed of the decision environment ("The deck")
- Data analysis adds alpha to your portfolio of decisions
