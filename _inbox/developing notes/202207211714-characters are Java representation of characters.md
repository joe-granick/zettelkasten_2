Characters are a Java primitive data-type that represent numbers letters and symbols. ^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]] **pg 19**]

Characters are encoded as 16-bit ($2^{16}$) integers in **Unicode** ^[[[202207211721-Unicode is common standard for encoding characters|202207211721]]]

Most commonly used characters are the ones most common to our normal life, numbers, letters, symbols and whitespace ^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]] **pg 19**]

Character literals can be created by enclosing a character in single or double quotation marks `'a'`^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]] **pg 19**]

Certain whitespace characters and operational characters use an escape sequence^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]] **pg 19**]

| character | escape sequence |
| --------- | --------------- |
| `'`       | `\'`            |
| tab       | `\t`            |
| new line  | `\n`            |
| `"`          |  `\"`               |
