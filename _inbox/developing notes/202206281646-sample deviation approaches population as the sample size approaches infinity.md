Population and sample variance/sd have different denominators (n vs n-1 respectively), but as sample increases the sample variance/sd should approach the population variance/sd[^1]

This is a bias correction as a sample of one can't have any variability, so a sample needs to be limited by one degree of freedom.

For practical purposes with a large enough sample the difference doesn't matter.[^1]
