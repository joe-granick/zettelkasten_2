Most methods to work with unsrtuctured data involve pre-processing the implcit structure into an implicit structure. For example a **bag of words** model can convert words into a matrix. For a corpus of tweets each tweet will be represented by a row in the matrix and frequently used words are represented as a seperate columns, where the count represents the number of times that word occured in the tweet.[^1][^2]
