The two main measures of variance are *standard deviation* and *variance*, they produce different numbers but contain the same information.[^1]
#### standard deviation
**36** *standard deviation* and *variance* both measure on average how far observations will be from the mean

$$\sigma= \sqrt{\frac{\sum^n _{i=1}(a_i-\bar a)^2}{n-1}}$$

#### variance
**37** population variance and sample variance have slightly different denominator
