- Data driven decision making (DDD) is the practice of making decisions based on an analysis of available data rather than on intuition [^1]
- DDD is not all or nothing and can be combined with intuition and other approaches to decision making [^1]

	-  SD 4% - 6%

	- ROE
	- ROA
	- asset utilization
	- market value
- two types of decisions enhanced by data analysis
	1. decisions for which discoveries need to be made within data
	2. decisions that repeat, ideally at a large scale so that small increases in decision making accuracy yield large returns
- predictive models abstract away details of world to focus on subset of factors correlated with a quantity of interest
