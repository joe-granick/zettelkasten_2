Expressions are how Java manipulates entities  producing new values ^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]]**pg 17**]

To do this Java takes combinations of literals, variables and operations on those values and evaluates the results of the operation. ^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]]**pg 16**]

The expression instructs Java formally how to perform a sequence of operations and represents the resulting value. ^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]]**pg 17]

Expressions are composed the *operands* being manipulated (variables and literals) and the  *operators* that represent the manipulation (must be compatible with the data-type)^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]]**pg 17]
