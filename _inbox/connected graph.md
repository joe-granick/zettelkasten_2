- a graph is **connected** if all *vertices* are related to each other either directly or indirectly
- one of two constraints that differentiates trees from other graphes is that all nodes in a tree must be *connected* [[all trees are graphs not all graphs are trees|all trees are graphs]]
	- tree is a connected graph with [[cycles|acycylic]] edges between vertices
- a connected graph means a path exists for any node to any othe node[[connected graph a node can be traversed to any other node]]
-  many networks, roadways, relationships can be modeled as a connected graph
![[unconnected graph.svg]]
- this network is unconnected graph
	- two pairs of firends
	- no one from either pair related to anyone in another pair
	- Bob has no relationships
- not every node can be reached staring at any other node in this network
