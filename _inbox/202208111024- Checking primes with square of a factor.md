If a number `a` is a factor of a larger number `n`, once we check all potential multiples smaller than the factor itself we can assume it is prime, because any factor would need to be larger. So if $a^{2} > n$ then if $n$ is not prime $b$ must be larger than n but there is no factor larger than $a^2$ possible.
