Writing a program in Java it is always important to know the **data-type** being worked with in programs.[^1]

This is because Java is a **strongly-typed** language and will create errors at compile time if the rules aren't adhered to.[^2]

The critical nature of distinctions in type means each one is well defined[^3]

Programs are not limited to the primitive types built in, and more complex programs can benefit from user defined data types.[^4]

 Strings are not a primitive data type, but are built into the language because of their importance for input and output.[^5]
