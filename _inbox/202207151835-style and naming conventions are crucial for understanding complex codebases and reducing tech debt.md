t is common to follow stylistic conventions ^[[[Computer Science an Interdisciplinary Approach]]**pg 16**]

While any naming convention can be used that complies with the syntax rules for identifiers^[[[202207130853-identifiers are Java representations for variable names|202207130853]]] it is recommended to chose descriptive naming conventions and a consistent style for variable names, in order to manage complexity.^[[[me]]]

This important for managing complexity, writing for descriptiveness and readability is important for understanding from a human perspective, even if the computations are the same.^[[[me]]]

This is especially important for large codebases and especially working with teams, where complexity can build up fast, and not everyone will have first hand knowledge of all elements of a program,^[[[me]]]
