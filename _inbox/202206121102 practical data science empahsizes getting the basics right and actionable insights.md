To be effective data scientists need the insight and experience to ask the right questions and be able to sense if an apporach is moving toward actionable inisghts[^1][^2]

Insights that cannot be acted upon rarely generate value or have lasting influence

Frequently the forest can be missed for teh trees when the focus on algorithms is overemphasized by DS practitioners. [^1]

However throwing mopre data and more compute at more advanced algorithms won't help if the fundamentals aren't in place [^1]

The fundamentals underpinning data science include the basics:
	- understanding the context of a problem or application domain [^1]
	- cleaning data and integrating relevant data sources[^1]
	- communicating results clearly, often to non-technical audiences[^1]
