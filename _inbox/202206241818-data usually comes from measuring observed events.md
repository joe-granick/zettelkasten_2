The data we see is usually what can be measured from events observed in the real world.[^1]

The data generating process is typically unknown, data is essentially the imprint left from the data generating process.

Probability is useful for reasoning about the process, but can't be utilized without the process at hand. If it were linited to this, it would only be useful for toy problems with manufactured rules like games of chance.

Statistics give us the tools for analyzing this real world data. Statistics takes the output of the data generating process and uses that to estimate the process that created it, so that the tools of probability can be brought to bear.

When combined these disciplines provide the toolset for reasoning about the likelihood of real world observations.[^2]
