>Direct quote

With new technologies are able to deal with data at a scale previosuly unheard of. [^(pg 3)]
Things that previously couldn't be mesured are now measureable, and things that could be measured are able to measured much more granularly.[^(pg 3)]

A wider variety of data and new methods are able to handle a variety of data that traditional methods couldn't incorporate because it wasn't structured properly. [^(pg 3)]

Datasets can now be in combined in ways previosuly unimaginable. And scientists can leverage CS tools and DS mindset to amplify signal that previosuly couldn't be perceived.[^(pg 3)]

Some of these advances include:
- genome sequencing in biology[^(pg 3)]
- full sky telescopes in astronomy[^(pg 3)]

Data scientists use advanced algorithms and measurement technology to work with large datasets and take a **data-driven** approach.[^(pg 3)]

Scientists traditionally take a **hypothesis-driven** but now able to collect data on a larger magnitude can also benefit from being **data -driven**. [[202206141355-hypothesis-driven vs data-driven science|hypothesis-driven vs data-driven]].[^(pg 3)]
