## vendor presentations
### [[quantum]] 
- largely unstructured data
- very difficult for customers to handle
- goals is to help process data faster for data intensive applications
	- AI
	- simulations
	- scientific computation
- type of storage
	- video
	- ISR
	- **WEKA PARNERSHIP FOCUSED ON AI**
- object storage implemented with combo of tape and solid state
- squarebox acuisition for asset management workflow
- organization broken down int functional workflow
- automatically tiers storage

#### application focus
- quantum and Nvidia have partnering on video metedata project
- uses AI
- main focus media, but important for many industries
- problem: 
	- video difficult to search
	- required metadata tagging
	- time to use is important and bottleneck in revenue generation
	- able to move video application out of cloud into local environment
- goals:
	- automated analysis of media files
	- extracting metdata
	- finding additional value in video data
	- build AI for customers
	- using AI replace tedious worfklows (vide monitoring)
- most optimal storage for [[WEKA]]
- unique [[3GO spread]]
	- data is spread 
	- increase durability
	- increased scalability
	- protect data at lower costs works with cloud object methodology
- active scale object storage
	- ulimited scale web
	- scale without rebalancing
- AI services
- acuquired Activescale for cold storage
	- durable
	- fast
	- failover storage
	- 


### [[WEKA]]
- distibuted file system for AI
- a data platform built for AI on a foundation of parallel file storage
- advantages
	- streaming performance
- specifically optimized for AI workflows
- optimized auto-tiered storage
- serves as an abstraction over data, so different workflows can work off of same data
- unified data platform
	- 1 tier of storage
	- 1 file system
	- 1 point of management
	- 1 copy of data
- uses: hpc, gpu, video streaming, genomics
