## vendor presentations
### [[quantum]] 
- largely unstructured data
- very difficult for customers to handle
- goals is to help process data faster for data intensive applications
	- AI
	- simulations
	- scientific computation
- type of storage
	- video
	- ISR
	- **WEKA PARNERSHIP FOCUSED ON AI**
- object storage implemented with combo of tape and solid state
- squarebox acuisition for asset management workflow
- organization broken down int functional workflow
- automatically tiers storage

#### application focus
- quantum and Nvidia have partnering on video metedata project
- uses AI
- main focus media, but important for many industries
- problem: 
	- video difficult to search
	- required metadata tagging
	- time to use is important and bottleneck in revenue generation
	- able to move video application out of cloud into local environment
- goals:
	- automated analysis of media files
	- extracting metdata
	- finding additional value in video data
	- build AI for customers
	- using AI replace tedious worfklows (vide monitoring)
- most optimal storage for [[WEKA]]
- unique [[3GO spread]]
	- data is spread 
	- increase durability
	- increased scalability
	- protect data at lower costs works with cloud object methodology
- active scale object storage
	- ulimited scale web
	- scale without rebalancing
- AI services
- acuquired Activescale for cold storage
	- durable
	- fast
	- failover storage
	- 


### [[WEKA]]
- distibuted file system for AI
- a data platform built for AI on a foundation of parallel file storage
- advantages
	- streaming performance
- specifically optimized for AI workflows
- optimized auto-tiered storage
- serves as an abstraction over data, so different workflows can work off of same data
- unified data platform
	- 1 tier of storage
	- 1 file system
	- 1 point of management
	- 1 copy of data
- uses: hpc, gpu, video streaming, genomics

### QBR
#### vision
> Vision of DI is to enrich, inspire, and serve through transformativr power of data
- want to capture some value from emerging tech, where partner offerings are unavailable
	- should be a unique differentiator

#### org structure
- focus around sales
- here to help sale steam educate customers
- in step w/ OCTO
- advisory is to facilitate sale motion not delivery
	- separate delivery team
- today a lot of infrastructure tying to move to  outcome driven AI solutions
- field CDO in development
	- help guide customers through strategy at C-Suite level

#### maturing an offering to release candidate
need to concentrate and align message with marketing
need to be aligned on what the business actually do
reps that work better together 
1. propsal
2. cost modeling
3. pitch deck
- battle card
- email campaign
EBCs briefings should be leading to paid engagements

##### cost model
- t-shirts, need relative idea of cost range
	- know the order of magnitude cost will be in
- *maturity* not having sales come back becasue document isn't ready for two weeks
- standadize communciation with sales across teams
	- need to know what we dow
	- how fast
	- need to be able to set expectations
- marketing bottleneck creating content
	- content over format

##### content
1. branded as stratascale
2. how are offerings promoted in regions
 - lunch and learns?
4. how is it delivered
	1. in house?
	2. partner?

##### industry use cases
1. decide what use cases can be solutioned quickly
2. assign team resources to evaluate feasibility of use cases from existing vendor components
3. prioritize: 
	- market relevance
	- opportunity size 
	- margin potential
	- delivery time
	- availability of delivery resources (internal/external)
4. add to solution and services catalogs
5. build GTM for strategic solutions by engaging
	- Marcomm
	- Partner management
	- Sales
	- EAs

##### DI Roadmap
critical to helping promote at executive level
- update from gartner use cases
- documentation  needs to be ready for sales
	- needs to be fresh and up to date
	- should be commonly accessible on sharepoint
	- sales should be able tp hand fofering catalog 1-pager upon client request
###### marketing roadmap
- blog posts
- webinars
- email update -> quarterly newsletter

##### areas of expertise
needs to be updated
- are these areas up to date
- are these the partners we want to focus
- should have GTM around every highlighted vendor
	- average deal size is it worth your time

##### focus on big strategic accounts
- cloud based data briefings? (Pepsi)
##### sales funnel
- awareness stage still important
