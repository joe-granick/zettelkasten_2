## Topic
>In recent years though, organizations have begun to notice a common problem: data stored within the warehouse is only accessible to technical users who know how to write SQL, and data living within a dashboard/report is only ever used by key stakeholders and decision-makers at a high-level to power operations.

- Data teams will typically surface data into a dashboard, biut this does a poor job of democratizing the data. 
- Typically dashboards will be catered towards executives and strategic metrics.
- Data for every day decision makers often buried/difficult to access.
- In frustration every day decision makers end up utilizing the tools they've been working with the entire time
