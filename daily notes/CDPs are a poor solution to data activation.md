## Topic
>CDPs ([Customer Data Platform](https://hightouch.io/blog/why-your-customer-data-platform-cdp-should-be-the-data-warehouse/)) rose up as one of the first solutions to tackle this problem by creating a single platform in the martech stack where companies could house all of their customer data and easily send it to other tools without having to worry about maintaining data pipelines. The downside is that CDPs simply create a second source of truth thatâ€™s based on the data warehouse, inevitably forcing organizations to move data out of their own cloud environment and pay for a third-party service. This can be quite problematic for highly regulated industries where privacy is a huge concern. In addition to this, CDPs only let users map data to unique objects like users and accounts. In reality, every company has complex data models (ex: workspaces).
