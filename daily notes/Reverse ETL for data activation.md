## Topic
>The name “Reverse ETL” makes people think of data replication or copying/pasting data from one database to another. In the Hightouch case, an example would be copying the Users table in Snowflake to the Contacts object in Salesforce. The key is that this operation is relatively simple: users → users data syncing. And it’s true that most Hightouch customers start with simple use cases like these.

>Originally we called ourselves Reverse ETL because our customers called us Reverse Fivetran, and for no reason other than that. Then, as we grew Hightouch, we built several new frameworks that expand past the concept of table → table data replication, which we describe in detail in the next section below.

>What about [Operational Analytics](https://hightouch.io/blog/what-is-operational-analytics/)? It’s just another name for Data Activation. Though we find Data Activation to be more aligned with our product and clearer to end-users: activate data from places you already have it stored, and make it available in places where you can take action.

>Our users have told us time and time again that they don’t understand what Operational Analytics means. They get confused because Operational Analytics sounds like analytics that someone does about their company’s operations.

>We want data teams to live front and center in their organizations, and be known for directly driving and impacting business metrics and empowering other teams with data. For that reason, Data Activation is more in-line with our vision.
