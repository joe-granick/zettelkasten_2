## Topic
>Infrastructure as a Platform ([iPaaS](https://hightouch.io/blog/the-future-of-data-integration-what-i-paa-s-and-workflow-automation-tools-got-wrong/)) tools arose as an alternative to CDPs, but these tools are equally challenging to use because they only move data from point to point (ex: sending Salesforce data to Hubspot), making it impossible to take advantage of the data models that exist in the warehouse. Moving data from one system to another with iPaaS tools is extremely challenging because these platforms force users to build complex workflows with multiple if/then statements and various dependencies in each step. Even worse, users have to create additional branches to account for errors/failures.
