## Data activation
>Today most companies are built around a modern data stack and although the technologies used across businesses often differ drastically, there are usually three core components that are consistent within every technology stack.

- **Data Acquisition**: Where data is created/collected from
- **Data Integrations**: Incorporating data into rest existing centralized data set(s)
- **Data Transformation**": Transofrmin raw data into a usable state, usually in the data warehouse
- **Analytics**: Where data is analyzed/ insights extracted (BI tools etc.)
