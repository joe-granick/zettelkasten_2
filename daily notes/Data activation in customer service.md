## Topic
>Dedicated customer success/support teams are the standard for every company today. These teams exist solely to quickly troubleshoot, debug, and solve problems for customers. In many cases, these problems are managed through ticketing systems and SaaS tools like Zendesk and Jira. Depending on the number of tickets submitted on a weekly basis it can quickly become impossible to address every customer and prioritizing leads is basically impossible.

>By feeding data from the warehouse directly to support tools, teams no longer have to wait for data to be keyed manually. As data is updated in the warehouse it can automatically be updated in the same success/support tools. With the necessary information for each ticket, these teams can prioritize based on urgency. Even better every time a ticket is created, it can be shared directly in communication platforms like Slack, enabling even faster response times.
