# Question
Q. Given an array of ints, compute recursively the number of times that the value 11 appears in the array. Weâ€˜ll use the convention of considering only the part of the array that begins at the given index. In this way, a recursive call can pass index+1 to move down the array. The initial call will pass in index as 0.
