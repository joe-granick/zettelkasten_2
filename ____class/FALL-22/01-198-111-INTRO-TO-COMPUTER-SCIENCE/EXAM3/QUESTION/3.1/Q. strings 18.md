A Palindrome is defined as a string that is the same both forwards and backwards. For example, "bob" and "otto" are both palindromes, while “hello” is not.
- Write a method that takes in a string and returns true if the string is a palindrome, false otherwise.
- Modify this method so that the detection is not case sensitive. For example, "Bob" and "OtTo" should now return true.
- Modify this method so that the detection ignores spaces. For example "nolemon,no melon" should now return true.

You may create three different methods like `palindrome()`, `palindrome2()`, and `palindrome3()`.
