## Week 4 - Algorithm Implementation: Conditionals and Loops
Topics: [[program design]], [[programming in Java]]
### 4.1 Conditionals And Loops involving if, if-else, while, for, do-while
**todo**
- [ ] *additional reading* **SCOPE OF VARIABLES**
<font style="color:red"><b>CLARIFY</b></font>
- **LO4.1[(c)]** are all parts of the initializing statements within a for loops considered to be part of **conditional statement**?
	- if not is there a specific name for this
- **LO4.1[(i),(e)]* how are **infinite loops** related to the following?
	- **infinite recursion** 
	- **The Halting Problem**
	- **Turing Machines**
- **LO4.1[(e)]** how does the difference in **iteration** order between a **for loop** and **while loop** impact the execution of the **iteration variable**
	- does this have any impact on the occurrence of an **infinite** loop due unnecessary inclusion of a semi-colon?
	- how about the likelihood of a logical error in variable iteration?
- **LO4.1[(n)]** what other variables are constrained by a **scope** conditions?
	- how does this related to?
		- **encapsulation**
		- **modularization**
		- **OOP**
		- **methods/functions**
		- **libraries/APIs**

#### 4.1a Write program code to satisfy program specifications using expressions, conditional statements, and iterative statements.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST9UcMZGlYI
- **Conditionals**
```
if (cakeSize <= 0)
{
System.out.println("Error: Cakes size must be greater than")
}
else {
	if (cakeSize <= 5){
		price = 10;
		}
}
```
- do not use semi-colon after if statement, as additional statements that will be executed conditional to the if need to be included
	- ends with braces
	- same as with **loops**
- *conditionals* allow you to execute different code, based on meeting different conditions that can be specified for different program states
#### 4.1b Determine how many times a program segment will execute.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByH95Lr_3W8
- **loops** type of conditional that continues to execute block of code as long as condition remains true
- **counting operations** same rule set for *Psuedocode*
- **remember**: conditional executes one extra time than the rest of the block when the execution is `false` as it evaluates the **Truthiness** of the condition and executes all statements when `True`, but when the condition executes to `false` the code following the conditional doesn't execute, but the conditional statement already was. So *for every* `n` *times the program executes the **conditional block** it executes the preceding **conditional statement***  `n+1` times
	- careful of this  when tracing with print statements
	- will always evaluate to `false` once ("if not stuck in infinite loop")
#### 4.1c Determine if two or more code segments result with the same outcomes.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYkIAqgaBc4
- **for loop** alternative **repetition structure**is equivalent computationally to **while loop** but afford more compact syntax that can be a more natural way to express certain operations
- consists of 3 parts:
	1. Evaluate **initialization statement**
	2. Evaluate **boolean expression** for conditional
	3. `if true` execute **body of loop** and **increment statement** 
- for loop is just a while loop written more concisely
<h4><font style="color:gray">4.1d Describe the behavior of code segments involving control structures</font></h>
#### 4.1e Describe why a given code segment does not work as intended.
<font style="color:red"><b>missing semi-colon</b></font>   after *conditional statement* 
- in a *while loop* the *body of loop* from executing, and therefore any code written to change the condition 
- Since the condition never changes it will never evaluate to `false`
- An **infinite loop** results when a loop's condition cannot evaluate to false, the loop continually executes preventing **transfer of control** to rest of program
	- sometimes the code block continually executes as well depending on how the error manifests
	- The *infinite loop* above is cause by a <font style="color:red"><b>syntax error</b></font>  where the semi-colon prevents the *body-of-the-loop* from exacting resulting in only the conditional being infinitely evaluated
	- a <font style="color:red"><b>logical error</b></font> can also be the source of an infinite loop, where all code is executed, but the *body-of-the-loop* code doesn't appropriately specify operations to change the variables of evaluation in a process by which the stop condition will be reached
		- may be simple as a missing iterator
		- may be complexity to interactions where condition may not be met under certain conditions
		- see **infinite recursion**
		- see **halting problem**
 <font style="color:red"><b>missing braces</b></font> around body-of-loop
 - syntactically braces aren't required
 - if braces aren't included the first statement following the conditional  will be executed as long as the loop condition evaluates to true
 - however any statement following the first will only be expected once, meaning code won't work as intended if intention was to executed more statements within the same loop condition 
- ==would there be any difference in operation of a **for loop** since **iterating variable** *is incremented within the conditional* statement *rather than the* *body-of-the loop* like in a *while loop?==*
<h4><font style="color:gray">4.1f Determine the most appropriate selection/control control structures for a particular specification.</font></h>
<h4><font style="color:gray">4.1g Implement and trace code involving compound assignment idioms within loops (i++).</font></h>
#### 4.1h Implement and trace code involving break and continue
- `break` and `continue statements` are ways to modify behavior of both for and while loops
- **break statement** exits the loop, returning control to next sequence in the program
	- careful with nesting and which loops are being broken out of
	- [7:03] may be a potential example problem
- **continue statement** skips execution of any following statements in *body-of-loop* for iteration returning to next iteration of the conditional statement
#### 4.1i Recognize conditions that would result in an infinite loop scenario.
- See **LO4.1e** error with unnecessary placement of semi-colon after while condition
#### 4.1j Describe the process and result of nesting control structures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALnbRzZSs-0
- 
#### 4.1k Trace program segments involving nested control structures.
#### 4.1l Write program code involving nested control structures.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ggvoTkDC2s
- putting an **if conditional** inside a **while loop**
- `i++` is a more concise way to increment a variable equivalent to `i= i+1` 
	- typically used for **iteration** in the for loop conditional statement
- **iteration** each individual execution of while loop<h4><font style="color:gray">4.1m Create appropriate test cases for if statements and test if statements in a comprehensive manner.</font></h>

#### 4.1n Identify the scope of variables within a program involving loops and conditionals.
https://youtu.be/s3jCMKDZ_s4
- any variable initialized within a loop  the **scope** is limited to the inside of the loop
	- a variable's **scope** is defined by the elements of a program that can utilize the variable 
	- this is a **local variable** because it is only available *locally* to the section of the program in which it is *encapsulated*
	- contrast this with a **global variable** which can be accessed *globally* by all parts of the program
- trying to use a variable <font style="color:red">outside of scope</font> like trying to use one initialized in an **inner loop** within the **outer loop** causes a <font style="color:red"><b>compile time error</b></font>
	- compiler doesn't know where to find variable, as no matching *identifiers* are initialized within that loop's **scope** initialized within that part of the program
	- rest of program can't use **local variable** in nested loop either

#### 4.1o Count the number of operations executed in program or program segment.
https://youtu.be/rABgH9d1dio
- counting operations follows *same principle as pseudocode*
- 
<h4><font style="color:gray">4.1l Use debugging tools to step through code in order to identify errors at various stages of program development.</font></h>
