# What is Big O
- Estimates worst case scenario efficiency wrt space and time use wrt input size
- machine independent
- represented as total operations as a function
- only concerned with highest order polynomial

# Focus on
- $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$
- $\mathcal{O}(n)$
- $\mathcal{O}(\frac{m}{n})$
-  $\mathcal{O}(nlog(n))$
- $\mathcal{O}(log(n))$
- $\mathcal{O}(1)$

# Time and Space Complexity
- processing with for loop is $\mathcal{O}(1)$ because only need to create iterator variable, array is already given

# Mystery functions
- be able to explain what function does and what the time complexity is

# Searching and Sorting
- know [[time complexity]] of [[search]] [[]]
