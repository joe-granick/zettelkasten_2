## Recap
1. What are basic primitive data types
- Primitive data type
- Most important
	- Int
		- byte
		- short
		- int
		- long
	- Double
		- float
		- double
	- Boolean
	- Char
- Differences between int and long and float and double
	- difference between size
- Strings are basic but non-primitive

What are some logical operators
`> < >= <= == != True|False && ||`

## HW1 Review
Q3 - Should be 11, Make sure to double check all operations
	- (missed that it was if not if else)
Q4: Need another variable

# Notes
Code: 


## Problem: Find the Bugs - Variable Assignment
- Study syntax
## Syntax Bugs
## Why Not
## Problem Boolean Truth Table
## Boolean Function
## 4 Input Truth Table

## N Input Truth 
- need $2^{n}$ rows for $n$ input truth tables
- each successive row alternate `t/f` at decreasing rates
## Problem Type Casting/Arithmetic
- String implicitly cast when concatenating other data type
- add `char` actually results in adding the ascii values and return an `int` 
## Problem - Determine Output
