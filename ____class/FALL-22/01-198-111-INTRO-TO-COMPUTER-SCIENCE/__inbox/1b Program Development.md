### Program Development in Java
- 3 step process with feedback

1. Edit program
2. Compile program to executable
	- Java compiler creates Java bytecode file
	- First checks for syntax errors
3. Run program
	- Use Java runtime
	- Returns program output
	- This is legal Java program, but may still have **run-time errors**
- If mistake at any point, return to step 1 and edit
- Continue to iterate through until program is error free.
