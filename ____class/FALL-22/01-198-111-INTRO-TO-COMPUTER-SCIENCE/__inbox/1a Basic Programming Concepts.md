### Why Program?
	- Need to be able to tell a computer to do what you want it to
	- Can't do it in natural language
	- Pre-packaged apps may not exist for your specific need
### Programming
- Can be learned by anyone
- Satisfying creative experience
- Enables us to do things that otherwise wouldn't be possible
- Created a whole new academic/intellectual domain that bears fruitful research to this day
- Challenges before being able to start
	- Need to know **what a computer can do**
	- Need to learn a **programming language** in order to communicate with the computer
		- *"Instead of imaging that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on **explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do**."* -*Don Knuth*
### Telling a computer what to do
- **Machine language**
	- Lowest Level
	- Easy for computer
	- Error-prone for humans
- **Natural language**
	- Easy for humans
	- Error-prone for computer
		- computers only carry out what told to do, cannot interpret context
		- ambiguity of interpretation
- **High-level language**
	- Middle ground
	- Some difficulty for both computers and programmers but makes worst case scenario for either dramatically more bearable
	- Acceptable tradeoff
### Why Java
- Naive-ideal- one programming language for everything
- **Java features**
	- Widespread
	- Continuously updated and developed since early 90s
	- Modern abstractions
	- garbage collection
	- memory management
	- Automatic checks
- **Java Economy**
	- Mars Rover
	- Cell phones
	- Blu-ray Disc
	- Web servers
	- Medical devices
	- Supercomputers
	- etc
- Millions of developers
	- **large community** for help
	- diverse growing ecosystem of libraries and tools
- **No language perfect**
	- All languages will have tradeoffs
	- Some languages better suited to different tasks
	- "*There are only two types of languages, those people always gripe about and those nobody uses.*" -Bjarne Strourtrup
- Focus on **general programming elements** common to most programming languages
- most essential elements
- don't worry about implementation differences and idiosyncracies
- elements common to almost all programming languages, means rest of language will be easy to pick up 
### Anatomy of java program
		![[Pasted image 20220921141909.png]]
- Program name `HellWorld` in Java must match filename `HelloWorld.java`
- All java programs have **main method**
	==- what is main method?==
	==- what are other methods?==
- Body contains code to execute
	- **Statements**
- Same program can be written different ways, stylistically and still execute the same
- Different styles are more appropriate in different **contexts**
	- IDE
	- Booksite
	- Book
	- Personal code
- **Enforcing** consistent style may
	- Stifle creativity
	- obfuscate what is actually required by language vs what is just a stylistic choice
	- confuse user if different style encounters
- **Emphasizing** consistent style may
	- make code easier to read and use
		- benefits others who may have to work w/ someone elses codebase
		- benefits you when you have to revisit previous code
	- makes code easier to organize
	- makes errors easier to locate
	- enables a development environment to provide visual cues
