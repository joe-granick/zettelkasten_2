- `summary`
	- useful for initiak quick view of data frame
- `tapply` -
	- `aggregate` similiar and creates a dataframe
- `table`- breaks a dataframe into a contingency table
	- needed before doing a mosaic plot
	- can combine table and subset to return same result as `tapply`
	- **POSSIBLE QUIZ QUESTION** - 
		- what is mean grade for econ seniors
		- what's mean for A for economics students

## Which plot to use and when

### Key considerations
**Data type**
	- Categorical
	- Numerical 
	- Ordinal (star ratings)
### Types

#### Bar graphs
- 
categorical variable
- for each category, get frequency
- can do bar graph based on `tapply()` function
	- for each room type plot maean price
	 1. first calculate means with `tapply()`
	2. 

#### Pie chart
- essentially the same idea as abar graph in a different representation

#### Box Plot
- Shows distribution of numerical variable as a function of categorical variables

#### Mosaic plot
- uses `table()` function 

#### Histogram
- frequency distribution
- binning is important

#### Scatterplot
- two numerical variables
- shows relationship between variables

### Which one to use
**POTENTIAL QUIZ**

## What's important about graphs
## What's interesting
- contradictory info
- outliers
- high correlations
- Top K and Bottom K vals
- Lack of an relationship

### What's actionable
- Sweden has higher cost of living -> a consideration that can change whether you move to sweden
