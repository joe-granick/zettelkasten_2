**descriptive statistics** form of data reduction [[202206111633c4-descriptive statistics reduce large data sets into summary statistics that provide more insight about the distribution than looking at it all at once|202206111633c4]]
- [[measures of center]] "describes" typical observation [[202206111633c4a-central tendency like mean median and mode describe center of distribution around which data is spread|202206111633c4a]]
- [[variability measures]] important for communicating how much observations differ from the average** [[202206111633c4b-variability measures describe how far the data is spread around the center|202206111633c4b]]
	- variance outlier sensitive [[202206111633c4b1-sum of squares penalty makes variance sensitive to outliers, one point d units adds as much variance as d^2 points one unit|202206111633c4b1]]
- mean and variability combined describe characteristics of any distribution well [[202206111633c4c mean and standard deviation TOGETHER  characterize  any distribution well|202206111633c4c]]  
	- mass isn't necessarily close to mean [[202206111633c4c1-mass of probability not necessarily concentrated close to the mean|202206111633c4c1]]
	- At least 75% of data within 2 SD of mean [[202206111633c4c2 For all distributions75% of data must be within 2 SD of mean and 89% within 3 SD|202206111633c4c2]]
