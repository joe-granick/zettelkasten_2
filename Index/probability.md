# Probability
***Probability** provides framework for evaluating uncertainty [[202206111633c2-probability provides formal framework for assessing uncertainty|202206111633c2]]*

- **Experiment** [[202206111633c2a- Experiments yield one outcome from from a larger set|202206111633c2a]]
- **Sample Space** [[202206111633c2b-Sample space represents experiment outcomes|202206111633c2b]]
- **Event** 
	- [[202206111633c2c-event is subset of outcomes specified with same result|202206111633c2c]]
		- *complement* [[202206111633c2c1-complement prob useful alternative that often simplifies prob calculation|202206111633c2c1]]
- **Outcome**
	- probability of outcome
		- [[202206111633c2d-probab of individual outcome less than 1, prob of all must sum 1|202206111633c2d]]
		- [[202206111633c2e- prob of outcome is sum of prob of all underlying outcomes|202206111633c2e]]
- **Random Variable** [[202206111633c2f-Random Variable  a FUNCTION that takes outcomes as input|202206111633c2f]]
- **Expected Value** [[202206111633c2g-expected value is the average value of random variables adjusted for probability|202206111633c2g]]
	- ==[[202206241028-Expected value framework allows you to assess value of probabilistic decision making]]==

## Compound Events/Independence
### Compound Events
 - **Set operations** [[202206111633c2h1-compound events use set operations to combine events and find complex probability|202206111633c2h]]
	 - **Set Difference**[[202206111633c2h1a-set difference calculates mutually exclusive outcomes of complex events|202206111633c2h1a]]

### Independent Events**
- independence unhelpful for predictions[[202206111633c2h2- independent events prob easier to calculate but  not informative for prediction and inference|202206111633c2h2]]
	- correlation critical [[202206111633c2h2a-correlations are critical to predictive modeling and inference|202206111633c2h2a]]
## Conditional Probability**
- [[202206111633c2h3-conditional probability needed to find likelihood of an event as a function of another event|202206111633c2h3]]
- **Baye's Theorem** 
	- [[202206111633c2h3a-bayes theorem simplifies conditional probability by reversing the dependence|202206111633c2h3a]]
	- ==[[202206111633c2h3b-Bayes theorem useful to update probability in light of new data|202206111633c2h3b]]==

## Probability Distributions
- [[202206111633c2k-a probability density function represents the probability of all random variable values in a sample space]]
- [[202206111633c2k1-A histogram is a statistical corollary to a PDF and from the frequency of observed events]]
- [[202206111633c2k2-histograms can approximate the PDF of observed value frequencies]]
- [[202206111633c2k3- CDF are alternative representation of random variable prob containing same info as PDF]]
