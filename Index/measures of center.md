**Measures of center**"describes" typical observation [[202206111633c4a-central tendency like mean median and mode describe center of distribution around which data is spread|202206111633c4a]]

**mean**
- **arithmetic mean** [[202206111633c4a1a-arithmetic mean most useful for symmetric distributions but is sensitive to outliers|202206111633c4a1a]]
- **geometric mean** for ratios [[202206111633c4a1b-geometric mean captures central tendency of ratios better than arithmetic mean|202206111633c4a1b]]
- **harmonic mean** for averaging rates [[202206111633c4a1c-harmonic mean measures average rate]]
**median**
- median characterizes typical observation than mean for skewed datasets [[202206111633c4a2-median is a better measure than mean for datasets with outliers and skewed distributions|202206111633c4a2]]
**mode**
